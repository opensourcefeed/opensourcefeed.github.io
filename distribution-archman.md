**Archman** is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution intended to make the computing easier for beginners and advanced developers. The project descriptions states, it makes things easier but keeps the gate open for all range of users.

Despite having Turkish origin, Archman defaults to the English language. Also, the website and documentation are provided in English to make it easier for global users.

Archman ships  Xfce, MATE, Plasma and LXQt editions by default. If there is enough user demand, the team is ready to ship other flavors also.

In addition to the access to whole Arch repositories, Archman maintains their repository to provide the distribution specific customizations and improvements.
