**Archman** is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution intended to make computing easier for beginners and advanced developers. The project description states, it makes things easier but keeps the gate open for all range of users.

Despite having Turkish origin, Archman defaults to the English language. Also, the website and documentation are provided in English to make it easier for global users.

Archman ships Xfce, KDE Plasma, Mate, Deepin, Gnome, Lxde, and Lxqt versions editions. Xfce is the flagship desktop environment used in the Archman projects.

In addition to the access to whole Arch repositories, Archman maintains its repository to provide distribution-specific customizations and improvements.
