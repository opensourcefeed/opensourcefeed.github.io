**Arya Linux** is collection of build tools and scripts to build your own GNU/Linux distribution
from scratch. These build scripts have been composed from the instructions provided in the LFS 
and BLFS books.

AryaLinux comes in two flavours Mate and XFCE and supports the x86_64(Intel 64-bit) platform. 
Apart from the basic Mate Desktop Environment, AryaLinux also comes with applications for Office 
productivity, simple graphics packages, browser and network utilities and System tools. A lot of 
packages other than the ones that are shipped by default, can be installed using alps in AryaLinux.
