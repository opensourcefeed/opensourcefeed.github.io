Despite of having several options and cool effects, Plasma is lighter in terms of resource usage. It takes almost one 3rd of memory used by it's main competitor, ie, GNOME Desktop.

Plasma Desktop is backed by Qt frameworks and KDE Applications.

The Plasma Desktop provides a cool desktop experience which makes use of modern design approaches. The visual effects used in Plasma is scalable and can support a wide range of display devices. These visual effects are not only good looking but also less stressful for eyes and thus dramatically improves productivity.
