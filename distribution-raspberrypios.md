**Raspberry Pi OS** is the official operating system for Raspberry Pi single-board computers. It is based on Debian Linux and optimized for performance, low power consumption, and ease of use, making it ideal for education, tinkering, and DIY projects.

Raspberry Pi OS provides a lightweight LXDE/Openbox desktop environment, enhanced with Raspberry Pi–specific tools, educational resources, and drivers. It also comes with a 64-bit edition for modern Pi boards.

There are three editions available:

- Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop – A full desktop experience including Chromium browser, LibreOffice, and recommended apps.
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite – A minimal, command-line only version for headless setups and servers
- Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop and Recommended Software – Preloaded with extra applications and tools for learning and development.

With frequent updates tied to Debian releases, Raspberry Pi OS ensures long-term support, security, and compatibility with the Raspberry Pi hardware ecosystem.
