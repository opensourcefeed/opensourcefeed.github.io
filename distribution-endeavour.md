**EndeavourOS** is an [Arch](/distribution/arch)-based GNU/Linux distribution. It provides a simple installer, preconfigured desktop environments, and tools that make Arch accessible to more users.

The project was created by former [Antergos](/distribution/antergos) community members after Antergos ended in 2019. EndeavourOS follows a different approach in design and principles, and it has quickly built a distinct identity among Linux distributions.

EndeavourOS keeps the base system minimal and close to Arch Linux. This reduces complexity in package management and system configuration while giving users flexibility and control. Its simplicity and close alignment with Arch Linux make it popular among both new and experienced users.
