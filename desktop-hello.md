**helloSystem** is a desktop system targeting users whose main focus is simplicity, elegance, and usability. It follows the general design principles put forward by mac in the 90s to give a consistent user experience.

The helloSystem is not planning to have a 1:1 replica of mac desktop. But, it will follow the general design guidelines of mac to provide a familiar experience for users migrating from the mac ecosystem.

With general principles, helloSystem provides a global menu bar, and other essential and familiar components in the macintosh systems. It will also focus on minimizing the configuration options, and thus complexity. It will provide a default system that will work out of the box.

The helloSystem is not yet ready for production use. You may try and explore the development releases, as explained on [the project's website](https://hellosystem.github.io/docs/user/getting-started.html).
