This release is built on top of Debian unstable snapshot from 29th December 2017 with some enhancements like a brand new installer, various useful scripts &amp;amp; packages, and a patched Linux Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/siduction201810.png&quot; alt=&quot;Siduction 2018.1.0 banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidcution 2018.1.0 comes in various flavors. The desktop flavors include KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg, and noX. Currently, GNOME, MATE &amp;amp; LXDE flavors and largely unmaintained. Depending on the availability of volunteers, these flavors may be discontinued in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.siduction.org/2017/12/release-notes-for-siduction-2018-1-0/&quot;&gt;original release announcement for Siduction 2018.1.0&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;KDE Plasma stands at version 5.10.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with
some packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.18.3. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If no one steps up to keep them in a releasable state, we might have to drop these flavors with our next release. The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This release comes with the name “patience 2018.1.0”. How we deal with
this in the future is unclear. The next release, which might be there in March, in advance of CLT 2018, will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it’ll be just numbered…&lt;/p&gt;

This release brings support for installation on the RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) without losing fine tuning between performance and resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/cld-mini.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;File picture of Calculate Linux 17.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculate Linux 17.12 is available in 8 different flavors. The Calculate Linux Desktop (CLD) comes with KDE Plasma. There are other alternative desktop flavors featuring Cinnamon, MATE &amp;amp; XFCE. In addition to desktop flavors, it includes Calculate Directory Server (CDS), Calculate Linux Scratch (CLS), Calculate Scratch Server (CSS) and Calculate Container Scratch (CCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the notable highlights in Calculate Linux 17.12 can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SoftRaid support added.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fixed autopartitioning problems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Third-party overlays supported.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Calculate Utilities server does not run in the background. Instead, it is launched by D-Bus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The MuQSS patch was included in the kernel configuration for better application task scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The UKSM patch was included in the kernel configuration for less memory load.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PAE binary kernel supported for 32-bit systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All server kernel settings optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GCC completely updated to v6.4 and the kernel updated to v 4.14.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In CLDC, CLDM and CLDX Pidgin were replaced by Gajim. The “httpupload, “image” and “URL image preview” come included.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The LXC/LXD container version was renamed to Calculate Container Scratch (CCS).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;11 493 binary packages are available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

One of the major highlights of this release is the inclusion of various firmware drivers to provide better support for WiFi devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/slax93.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Application Launcher in Slax 9.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of additional firmware drivers makes the Slax image a little bigger (around 40 MB). Though, this can be justified by support for various WiFi devices. A bigger distribution with network capabilities is definitely better than a small distribution without networking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes in Slax 9.3 includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There were some regression tests to identify issues while booting from alternative file systems. Some of the issues have been identified and corrected during this phase. This mainly includes the ability to boot from NTFS and ext4 file systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If booted from a writable storage medium, Slax enables persistence by default.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;added pcmanfm as file manager for GUI&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;added wicd as wifi network manager&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;xLunch now auto updates, to see newly installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;hard drives are mounted on boot and bookmarks added to pcmanfm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;keyboard layout stays persistent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;screen resolution change is reimplemented to make it work better&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;syslinux updated to newest version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

This release brings various package updates from upstream project, ie, Arch and other cool improvements in visual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArchLabs as an Arch based distribution, usually ships rolling release. However, considering some significant changes in the distribution, ArchLabs team decided to ship another snapshot release. This will be the final release of project in this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/archlabs_2017-12-22-24_1366x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;A preview of ArchLabs 2017.12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major change in ArchLabs 2017.12 is the removal of Calamares installer in favor of ABIF. This was done by the discretion of core developers. It will also help the distribution to cut the image size by a few megabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights in ArchLabs 2017.12 includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;jgmenu a very cool menu has been added to Polybar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Polybar itself has had another makeover, and I think it is looking super sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacli has been forked for use with ArchLabs.  All the options now work as they should.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;new default monospaced font has been added, the very stylish Fantasque Sans font.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The obligatory change to the default wallpaper, which is pretty much expected upon every release.  I personally have prescribed to the “Ubuntu Theorem of New Release Wallpaper“, which is “slightly changed but still the same”.  I think this brings a consistent and recognizable look to ArchLabs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Numerous minor changes across the board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Polybar-zen, that’s all I’m saying…..lol.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Oblogout has been removed, rofi-logout has replaced this.  Looks good too.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Al-Hello has had another upgrade and is looking incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This release comes with improved stability to provide a more reliable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dramatic improvements in various components &amp;amp; tasks such as OpenRC, boot speed, removable device management, SysAdm API integrations ..etc. The Lumina Desktop has also got several improvements since the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/post-images/trueos17.12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TrueOS 17.12 release banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes in the desktop release, the team was also working on TrueOS server edition. As a proof of this, the team has introduced a new text-based server image with support for Virtualization systems such as &lt;em&gt;bhyve&lt;/em&gt;. This server image also takes advantage of various improvements in FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the important highlights in TrueOS 17.12 release can be summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Over 1100 OpenRC services have been created for 3rd-party packages. This should ensure the functionality of nearly all available 3rd-party packages that install/use their own services.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The OpenRC services for FreeBSD itself have been overhauled, resulting in significantly shorter boot times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Separate install images for desktops and servers (server image uses a text/console installer). The server image provides support for Bhyve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FreeBSD base is synced with 12.0-CURRENT as of December 4th, 2017 (Github commit: 209d01f)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FreeBSD ports tree is synced as of November 30th (pre-FLAVOR changes)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lumina Desktop has been updated/developed from 1.3.0 to 1.4.1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PCDM now supports multiple simultaneous graphical sessions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Removable devices are now managed through the “automounter” service.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are “announced” as available to the system via .desktop shortcuts in /media. These shortcuts also contain a variety of optional “Actions” that may be performed on the device.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are only mounted while they are being used (such as when browsing via the command line or a file manager).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are automatically unmounted as soon as they stop being accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Integrated support for all major filesystems (UFS, EXT, FAT, NTFS, ExFAT, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The TrueOS update system has moved to an “active” update backend. This means that the user will need to actually start the update process by clicking the “Update Now” button in SysAdm, Lumina, or PCDM (as well as the command-line option). The staging of the update files is still performed automatically by default but this (and many other options) can be easily changed in the “Update Manager” settings as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

Similar to previous releases, this release also brings 64 bit and 32 bit installation images. The 64 bit release provides complete support for UEFI systems and secure boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/peppermint8respin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peppermint 8 Respin banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a minor release in Peppermint 8 series, the &lt;em&gt;Respin&lt;/em&gt; release brings some package updates &amp;amp; bug fixes. Following are some significant changes introduced in Peppermint 8 Respin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nemo 3.4.7 - It seems more stable during large file operations, and now has a separate process for controlling the desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;OpenVPN updated in the repos to version OpenVPN 2.4.4 to support mixed mode IPv4/IPv6 VPN’s.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Switched from lightdm-gtk-greeter to slick-greeter, to provide a much simple and elegant login screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Added a desktop right-click “Open Peppermint Settings Panel” context menu item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Installed mint-translations, so included mint applications are now available with non-English translations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fixed peppermint-proxy-configuration on the 32bit ISO.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improved i3lock lock-screen, similar to the previous one but with a neater looking clock that can be changed between 12hr and 24hr&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Advert Blocker reinstated by request, available in the main menu not in the Peppermint Settings Panel.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New &lt;em&gt;Peppirus&lt;/em&gt; icon theme &amp;amp; Gtk theme.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Changed default wallpaper to Peppermint-3D-Logo-Alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Three additional Ray Bilcliff wallpapers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disabled Gtk overlay scrollbars, so the scrollbars don’t overlay other window content making it difficult to see.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Repository now contain tweaked versions of screenfetch and neofetch with custom Peppermint logo ASCII art.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Slightly larger terminal window defaults so neofetch/screenfetch have the room necessary to display properly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Started adding non-English translated versions of ICE to the repos .. more languages will be added later as we create them (we’re putting in a lot of effort into having full non-English translations for ALL applications hopefully by Peppermint 9).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All other updates from Lubuntu 16.04.x LTS series.&lt;/li&gt;
