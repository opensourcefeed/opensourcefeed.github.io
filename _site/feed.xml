This release has been rebased to Debian &lt;em&gt;Stretch&lt;/em&gt; current stable release. It includes several updated packages and implementation of several strategical decisions taken by the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-neptune-5-refresh-release&quot;&gt;What is new in Neptune 5 ‘Refresh’ release?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Debian base change, Neptune 5 comes with several strategical changes regarding the OS release approach itself. Let’s have a quick summary of main highlights in Neptune 5 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neptune 5 has been rebased to Debian 9.x &lt;em&gt;Stretch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beginning from this release, Neptune would not be providing the latest version of Plasma Desktop, Linux Kernel or other applications. The project will just reuse the components from upstream project. If users are curious to explore the bleeding edge applications, then cross distribution supported app formats like Flatpak, snaps, and AppImage can be used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The main purpose of Neptune OS is to provide a robust desktop experience. Towards this goal, Neptune 5.0 includes Plasma Desktop 5.12 LTS, KDE Applications 17.12 and KDE Frameworks 5.43.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux Kernel 3.14 from Debian stretch backports repository is included to provide better hardware support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neptune 5.0 drops the support for proprietary packages and &lt;em&gt;zevenoshardwaremanager&lt;/em&gt;, the tool enables easy installation of proprietary drivers has been removed. Now, users should find their own way if proprietary drivers are required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neptune 5.0 brings a refreshed user experience with a reiterated set of artworks. It provides a consistent experience across Gtk+2, Gtk+3, Qt4 and Qt5 applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are multiple themes available in the default installation of the Neptune and can be easily switched between these themes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated packages like LibreOffice 6, Chromium 64, Thunderbird 52.6, Amarok 2.9, VLC 2.2 ..etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Just like in rolling edition, Netrunner 18.03 also includes &lt;em&gt;Yarock&lt;/em&gt;, a Qt-based music player which supports a wide range of online streaming networks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;, the plasma software center is back in Netrunner desktop edition. Also, there is firefox with plasma integration and suse image writer. &lt;em&gt;MintUpdate&lt;/em&gt; is still available in this release to enable update in a classical way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Netrunner 18.03 features settings window with sidebar layout. All UI related customization options can be found under &lt;em&gt;Plasma Tweaks&lt;/em&gt; tab.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various updated packages like
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;KDE Plasma 5.12.2&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;KDE Frameworks 5.42&lt;/li&gt;

This snapshot includes various updates from base distribution, latest Linux Kernel with &lt;em&gt;Meltdown&lt;/em&gt; vulnerability patch, and a centralized Control Center called &lt;em&gt;SolydXK System Settings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/solydxk-home-banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;SolydXK banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installation, SolydXK provides a Welcome App from which users can choose additional packages to install. This LetoDMS (Document Management System) has been removed from Welcome Application as it is not working well with SolydXK. It is also removed from project repositories. The SolydXK team suggests to use SeedDMS instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, SolydXK is basically a Dutch operating system, it provides international community as well. The project maintainer has decided to maintain an official German image to accomodate German users. Community editions like 32 bit image and Enthusiast’s editions (based on Debian Buster) will be made available in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights from SolydXK 201801 release includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Device Driver Manager (DDM) has been integrated.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Debian Plymouth Manager has been integrated.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add new partitions to Fstab.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Safely remove old kernel packages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This issue was a hot discussion topic in Linux communities for past few days and it has raised a serious question on the credibility of Ubuntu and it’s derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/lubuntu17101.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lubuntu 17.10.1 banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An update for Kernel in (L)Ubuntu 17.10 with Intel SPI drivers enabled was causing the issue with Lenovo BIOS. It affects the persistence of BIOS changes, USB boot and modifiability of EFI entries. You can learn more about this issue in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1734147&quot;&gt;launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lubuntu 17.10.1 has been released to fix a major problem affecting many Lenovo laptops that causes the computer to have BIOS problems after installing. .&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Please note that the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities have not been fixed in this ISO, so we advise that if you install this ISO, update directly after.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This release is no different in terms of features from the 17.10 release and is comparable to an LTS point release in that all updates since the 17.10 release have been rolled into this ISO.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Window Previews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hotcorners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quicknote&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Team member Jacob has been busy again - another optional applet you may wish to use called “DropBy”. This one automatically pops up whenever a USB device is added. You can mount/unmount, copy the USB device contents and open in Files all from the popup.
Nice! Well done Jacob 😁&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Will be polishing in the next few days and will release to the 17.10 backports PPA and you can use budgie-welcome to install.&lt;/p&gt;

This snapshot brings various updated packages, bug fixes and enhancements over the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feren OS 2018.1 (Let me call it in that way) provides a smooth update path from previous release via update manager. A clear update path between releases is one among the objectives of ferenOS!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/ferenOS18.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Update Software Manager in feren OS 2018.1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing from release announcement, following are some of the notable highlights of feren OS 2018.1 comparing to its predecessor released in October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A new set of wallpapers called &lt;em&gt;Unsplash Wallpaper Set&lt;/em&gt;. This includes several refreshing wallpapers. In addition to wallpapers provided in the default installation, you may also install &lt;em&gt;feren-extra-background&lt;/em&gt; package to get more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;feren OS 2018.1 release is based on Linux Mint 18.3. So, it brings various package updates from base distribution. Software Manager (Mint) is one of the key highlights. It provides a modern UI to manage applications easily. It also provides support for Flatpak. In feren OS 2018.1, GNOME Software is replaced with Mint Software Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Custom themer theme - feren OS 2018.1 will let you create and install your own custom theme. You can explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feren/Themer-Store&quot;&gt;project’s repository&lt;/a&gt; to get started with creating your custom theme.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The themer tool is now integrated with Theme App, which is available in control center. This will help you to choose between various themes and layouts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

As a beginning of diversification effort, Mr Hayder Ctee on behalf of Uruk team has announced the availability of Uruk 2.0 Xfce edition.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/post-images/uruk-software-center.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Siduction 2018.1.0 released, based on Debian unstable</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/siduction-201810-released-based-on-debian-unstable/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Siduction 2018.1.0 released, based on Debian unstable" /><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/siduction-201810-released-based-on-debian-unstable</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/siduction-201810-released-based-on-debian-unstable/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; Siduction community has released Siduction 2018.1.0, the first release of Debian unstable based GNU/Linux distribution in 2018. This release is built on top of Debian unstable snapshot from 29th December 2017 with some enhancements like a brand new installer, various useful scripts &amp;amp; packages, and a patched Linux Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/siduction201810.png&quot; alt=&quot;Siduction 2018.1.0 banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidcution 2018.1.0 comes in various flavors. The desktop flavors include KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg, and noX. Currently, GNOME, MATE &amp;amp; LXDE flavors and largely unmaintained. Depending on the availability of volunteers, these flavors may be discontinued in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.siduction.org/2017/12/release-notes-for-siduction-2018-1-0/&quot;&gt;original release announcement for Siduction 2018.1.0&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;KDE Plasma stands at version 5.10.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with
some packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.18.3. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If no one steps up to keep them in a releasable state, we might have to drop these flavors with our next release. The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This release comes with the name “patience 2018.1.0”. How we deal with
this in the future is unclear. The next release, which might be there in March, in advance of CLT 2018, will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it’ll be just numbered…&lt;/p&gt;

This release brings support for installation on the RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) without losing fine tuning between performance and resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/cld-mini.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;File picture of Calculate Linux 17.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculate Linux 17.12 is available in 8 different flavors. The Calculate Linux Desktop (CLD) comes with KDE Plasma. There are other alternative desktop flavors featuring Cinnamon, MATE &amp;amp; XFCE. In addition to desktop flavors, it includes Calculate Directory Server (CDS), Calculate Linux Scratch (CLS), Calculate Scratch Server (CSS) and Calculate Container Scratch (CCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the notable highlights in Calculate Linux 17.12 can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Fixed autopartitioning problems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Third-party overlays supported.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Calculate Utilities server does not run in the background. Instead, it is launched by D-Bus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The MuQSS patch was included in the kernel configuration for better application task scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The UKSM patch was included in the kernel configuration for less memory load.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PAE binary kernel supported for 32-bit systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All server kernel settings optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GCC completely updated to v6.4 and the kernel updated to v 4.14.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In CLDC, CLDM and CLDX Pidgin were replaced by Gajim. The “httpupload, “image” and “URL image preview” come included.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The LXC/LXD container version was renamed to Calculate Container Scratch (CCS).&lt;/li&gt;

One of the major highlights of this release is the inclusion of various firmware drivers to provide better support for WiFi devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/slax93.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Application Launcher in Slax 9.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of additional firmware drivers makes the Slax image a little bigger (around 40 MB). Though, this can be justified by support for various WiFi devices. A bigger distribution with network capabilities is definitely better than a small distribution without networking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes in Slax 9.3 includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There were some regression tests to identify issues while booting from alternative file systems. Some of the issues have been identified and corrected during this phase. This mainly includes the ability to boot from NTFS and ext4 file systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If booted from a writable storage medium, Slax enables persistence by default.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;added pcmanfm as file manager for GUI&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;added wicd as wifi network manager&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;xLunch now auto updates, to see newly installed apps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;hard drives are mounted on boot and bookmarks added to pcmanfm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;keyboard layout stays persistent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;screen resolution change is reimplemented to make it work better&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;syslinux updated to newest version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
