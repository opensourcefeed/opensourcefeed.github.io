This release includes numerous changes on underlying components and comes with better application support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wine is basically a compatibly layer for running windows binary executables on different POSIX compliant platforms like GNU/Linux, BSD and macOS. WINE is not a mere emulator, instead it maps windows system calls into native system calls on real time and hence provide better performance than an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/wine banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;WINE banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main highlight of WINE 2.0 is support for MS Office 2013, new office suite published by Microsoft Corporation and 64 bit application support in macOS operating system. It took almost one complete year to finish development of WINE 2.0 and it includes around 6,600 individual revisions after previous release. These revisoins provides support for a lot of new games and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINE 2.0 is first stable release in revised annual release plan for the project. When a release is published strict annual basis, there can be space for some incomplete changes and WINE 2.0 is not and exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    This release represents over a year of development effort and around 6,600 individual changes. The main highlights are the support for Microsoft Office 2013, and the 64-bit support on macOS.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    It also contains a lot of improvements across the board, as well as support for many new applications and games. See the release notes below for a summary of the major changes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    This is the first release made on the new time-based, annual release schedule. This implies that some features that are being worked on but couldn't be finished in time have been deferred to the next development cycle. This includes in particular the Direct3D command stream, the full HID support, the Android graphics driver, and message-mode pipes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Upgrade Tor to 0.2.9.9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade Linux to 4.8. This should improve the support for newer hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add support for exFAT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove Nyx (previously called arm).&lt;/li&gt;

Also, there are some companies like system 76 who mainly focus on building GNU/Linux powered laptops. Most of the big players like HP, Dell, Lenovo has introduced few special laptops to attract GNU/Linux enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keithcu has published an interesting article which takes us for a journey of running Arch Linux on a Lenovo Yoga 900, a modern laptop introduced by Chinese multinational technology company. This article can be seen as a hardware view. It starts the journey by mentioning source and price of the laptop and explains about different components of laptop in detail. Also it covers compatibility of the laptop with GNU/Linux operating system by taking Arch Linux as an example. Also, he has experimented with some Arch derivatives like Antergos and Manjaro.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I find Gnome classic a streamlined experience. I wish it wasn’t written in the clunky fad Javascript, and they re-enabled a community around custom themes and color schemes. It’s also still missing some nice features from Gnome 2 and Windows 10, and could be a bit more stable. Gnome 3.0 in 2011 was a step backwards, but six years later we’re up to Gnome 3.22, and things are mature again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Gnome Classic is one of the best GUIs, but there are a number of good ones and all are getting better. This machine is working quite well now and I’m just going to sit back and keep waiting for the HiDPI and other improvements! I’m looking forward to deep learning inside the grammar checker of LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping the habit of writing reviews on GNU/Linux distributions, Mr Garry Nevell, author of Everday Linux user portal has published a review of elementary 0.4 Freya, latest stable release of elementary available till date. This detailed review examines different aspects of operating system and reaches in a conclusion that, elementary is good looking distribution, though as Ubuntu and it’s derivatives it lacks a good package management system. The default applications are not the application used by masses and applications that comes in use need to be installed explicitly which is not an easy task for a newbie. The elementary operating system is shipping a Software Center however, it does not include popular packages like google chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The fact that somebody has had to go to the effort to create the Ubuntu After Install application shows there is a problem.

    Why can't Ubuntu or one of these derivatives grasp the bull by the horns and come up with a solution.
    People like to use Chrome yet all we get is Firefox or some basic equivalent. Chrome works with everything. It is by far the best browser and I don't want to settle for second best. 

    If you don't want to include it as part of the main package manager add a simple tool for installing this and many other applications including Steam.

Debian 9 Stretch Installer rc1. This release is coming after several alpha releases and 
can expect improved stability and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release of Debian installer reverts the switch to merge /usr as the default configuration 
of debootstrap as it raises a number of serious issues which might not be fixed in time 
for stretch. In next release cycle, this configuration will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous Alpha release (Alpha 6) Debian Pure Blends appeared in Software selection 
screen. There were some different opinions regarding this. How ever, it was n’t addressed 
during the freeze as freeze is not the phase where critical screens are expected to revamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some improvements made in this development release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;cdebconf-terminal:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from ttf-dejavu-mono-udeb to fonts-dejavu-mono-udeb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debian-installer:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Add HTTPS support through new ca-certificates and wget udebs&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from ttf-dejavu-udeb to fonts-dejavu-udeb.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from fonts-lklug-sinhala to fonts-noto-hinted-udeb for Sinhala&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Bump Linux kernel version from 4.7.0-1 to 4.8.0-2.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Update theme to softWaves by Juliette Belin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debian-installer-utils:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Add checksum verification to fetch-url.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;espeakup-udeb:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Avoid issues with sound board names containing spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Fix race conditions when starting espeakup.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch to espeak-ng (#833658).

This release includes some security fixes and resolutions for other critical issues reported in previous snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debian 8.7 is not a new release, instead an updated snapshot with updated packages. This is just a continuation of snapshots in Debian 8.x series. So you can install any other snapshot in this release and update your system using regular update means to get all upgraded packages and bug fixes as in 8.7 snapshot.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/Debian Banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Debian Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The Debian project is pleased to announce the seventh update of its stable distribution Debian 8 (codename &quot;jessie&quot;). This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories were already published separately and are referenced where available.

    Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian 8 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away old &quot;jessie&quot; CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to be updated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
