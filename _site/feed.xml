The rebasing is done for both installable ISOs and docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/kdeneon-18.04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu 18.04 based KDE neon - banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-rebasing-mean-for-kde-neon&quot;&gt;What does rebasing mean for KDE neon?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE neon is a distribution built to deliver the latest technologies from KDE family as soon as it is available. The images are built on top of Ubuntu LTS base and provide a strong platform to rely on. KDE neon is a part of KDE community itself instead of standing as a separate project. It provides the project an opportunity to work closely with KDE technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The migration to Ubuntu 18.04 &lt;em&gt;Bionic Beaver&lt;/em&gt; implies a set of updated packages, drivers and better hardware compatibility to KDE neon users. This will help the users to focus on their work instead of worrying about the outdated operating system. With rebasement, the KDE neon can focus more their &lt;em&gt;snap&lt;/em&gt; integration to provide a smooth installation for application from KDE family and other communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KDE neon provides a migration plan from Ubuntu 16.04 based installations. This migration path was thoroughly tested in the last few months, and most of the issues have been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a footstep to the upcoming Fedora 29 release. The beta release will show a strong resemblance with the final release. It provides an opportunity for individuals and corporates to ensure their required functionality is working properly. If not, they may file an issue with Fedora QA team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;availability-of-fedora-29-beta&quot;&gt;Availability of Fedora 29 Beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora 29 beta release announcement is applicable for all Fedora editions including Fedora Workstation, Server Edition, Atomic Edition, and the Silver Blue edition. It also offers popular variants as Fedora spins with an alternative desktop environment, Fedora Labs and ARM editions. These pre-release images can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/workstation/prerelease/&quot;&gt;Fedora Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-different-in-fedora-29-beta&quot;&gt;What is different in Fedora 29 Beta?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedora 29 Beta showcases a plethora of changes that we can expect in the final release. This includes the availability of modular repositories in all editions, GNOME 3.30 in Fedora 29 Workstation ..etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modular repositories&lt;/strong&gt;: Modular repositories are a way to keep multiple versions of same software parallelly. In Fedora 28, this was included in Server Edition only. Fedora 29 beta release introduces modular packages across all the editions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME 3.30&lt;/strong&gt;: Fedora 29 beta features GNOME 3.30, a recently released version of GNOME Desktop. It provides significant performance and usability improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other updates like The Fedora Atomic Workstation was rebranded as Fedora Silverblue, the GRUB menu will be hidden on single OS installation. Fedora 29 also includes updated versions of many popular packages like MySQL, the GNU C Library, Python and Perl.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-is-a-development-release-not-ready-for-production&quot;&gt;It is a development release, not ready for production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux Lite 4.2 beta is a development release meant to showcase the features in the upcoming stable release. It also gives community contributors to involve in the regression testing and to provide their feedback. As a development release, there could be critical issues with this release. A known issue is slow booting in some issues. This issue should be tested on multiple hardware configurations and need to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Linux Lite provides no direct update path from development release to stable release. So, it recommended to not install Linux Lite 4.2 beta on production systems in hope, it will become eventually stable.&lt;/p&gt;

This release comes with updated Linux Kernel and other applications. It also includes more consistent user experience with improved theming and other artworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/solus-3-iso-refresh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Solus 3 ISO refresh, a snap of different editions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently announced Solus 3 ISO refresh is identified by the version number 3.9999. It is available in all 3 official flavors of the Solus project, ie, Budgie, MATE and GNOME editions. Despite the edition chosen, Solus provides a consistent user experience across the entire system with the improved theming. It makes use of &lt;em&gt;Adapta&lt;/em&gt; for GTK theming and &lt;em&gt;Papirus&lt;/em&gt; for icon theming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solus 3.9999 brings Linux Kernel 4.18.5. It enables support for the recent CPUs from AMD and Intel. This includes the support for advanced technologies like high core count CPUs like AMD Threadripper 2. Additional hardware compatibility is enabled out-of-the-box by tuning kernel flags wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main changes in various Solus edition include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;: Removable Devices is extension is now enabled by default. It helps to mount/unmount partitions without opening Nautilus. The Nautilus is configured to open files and folders with a single click. Also, the thumbnail preview is enabled for network devices also. The search results in Nautilus have been limited to local in order to avoid performance delay.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATE&lt;/strong&gt;: A separator is added on the panel after the clock widget, to improve readability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This beta release is for curious technical users and 3rd party app developers to make their app working on Juno when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/elementary-Juno-beta-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;elementary Juno beta banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-juno&quot;&gt;What is new in Juno?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elementary Juno beta 2 release comes with a set of features and improvements that we can expect in the final release. The main changes in Juno beta2 release include,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The login screen and lock screen greeter is improved with better scaling on HiDPI screens. This is made possible with a simple compositor that provides things like shadows beneath the shutdown window and indicators. The indicator works more consistently on the desktop and on the login screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There have been multiple issue fixes in AppCenter. Banners on the home screen will have a glow on hover, based on the band color. Some old CSS styles were removed from the theme. These styles were required for pre-Gtk.3.20 release. elementary Juno uses Gtk 3.22.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Thumbnail in &lt;em&gt;Files&lt;/em&gt;, the elementary file manager, has been improved to show consistent thumbnails.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The stylesheet now provides an “inline” style for tab bars. This means if an app opts into this style, its tabs can better match the content they’re switching between instead of always being chrome-colored.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Music&lt;/em&gt; app has got multiple issues fixes to make it more stable. There is no visual improvement between beta 1 and beta 2, but there has been a rigor code cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There has been a lot of code cleanup and refinement into the far reaches of Photos. Most of it is not user-visible, but you might notice that almost all of the dialogs have been cleaned up and made more consistent with the rest of the elementary apps thanks to being moved to Granite.MessageDialog.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt; has UI improvements across the board, which make it look cleaner and be able to tile down to smaller sizes. A new inline tab bar style is introduced in the stylesheet across all three color schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manipulating the display settings is now more accurate with the Settings App. Now, this configurations is a lot more natural, especially in multiscreen setup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a stable release of Debian based GNU/Linux distribution with &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Window Manager&lt;/em&gt;. The Elive 3.0 is released on occasion of the eighth anniversary of the project. Samuel claims Elive 3.0 as the most stable release among the releases published so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/elive3.0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview Elive 3.0 Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-is-delayed-but-worth-to-try&quot;&gt;It is delayed, but worth to try!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elive 3.0 is based on Debian 8.x &lt;em&gt;Jessy&lt;/em&gt; branch. It is very late for a distribution to announce its first release based on Jessy. Most of the packages shipped in this release are quite outdated now. Mr. Samuel has justified the delay with the lack of contributors. Despite the outdated packages, he promises a rock solid, useful and beautiful system out of Elive 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elive-also-launches-a-new-website&quot;&gt;Elive also launches a new website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Elive 3.0, the project has also rolled an updated website with a modern look and feel. This website presents the purpose and features of Elive Linux in a very vivid manner. You can visit the Elive website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elivecd.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.elivecd.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After 8 years of silent development, the third stable version of Elive is out, the result is simply amazing and the integration is gorgeous, it is not even possible to describe every inside feature and the new website only contains a small portion of its characteristics.
Unfortunately not everything is rainbows and perfection, the lack of resources made the release being too much delayed, and this lead to old packages and drivers, but despite that, the final result is really worth it, Elive 3.0 is the most useful system ever made, perfect for the daily use, rock solid, beautiful and full of hidden features, with every simplified aspect to make it usable for any user level.
If all this was not enough this version is the most powerful version, maintaining its lightness in resources and blazing fast responsiveness, do not hesitate to put this polished and ready to use the operating system in every computer for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

In certain parts of the world, mobile is the most common platform used to access the internet. While there are a lot of surveillance projects to track the mobile Internet usage. This is a serious question against individual privacy and anonymity. The tor project is working on this issue for a while. So, we have Tor Browser for Android now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/tor-for-android.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview of Tor Browser for Android&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor project has announced the availability of Tor Browser for Android alpha release. This is the first time Tor project introducing the browser for Android. Presently, there is &lt;em&gt;Orfox&lt;/em&gt;, a browser that routes network through &lt;em&gt;Orbot&lt;/em&gt;. This project will be decommissioned once the Tor browser hits the stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor Browser alpha release is available on Google Play Store. The APK is also available directly from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha&quot;&gt;Tor website&lt;/a&gt;. Presently, the Tor Browser for Android requires Orbot to establish the connection through the Tor network. The final stable release will eliminate the dependency of Orbot, and users can directly browse with Tor Browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of Tor Browser for Android can be summarized as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BLOCK TRACKERS: Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can’t follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you’re done browsing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE: Prevent someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you’re using Tor.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;RESIST FINGERPRINTING: Tor aims to make all users look the same, so Tor Browser for Android makes it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION: When you use Tor Browser for Android, your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. Watch this animation to learn more about how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BROWSE FREELY: With Tor Browser for Android, you are free to access sites your local internet service provider may have blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/gnome3.30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview of GNOME Desktop 3.30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;With the improved performance, GNOME 3.30 can run multiple applications simultaneously, without affecting performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-gnome-330&quot;&gt;What is new in GNOME 3.30?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME 3.30 is a major release from popular open source desktop environment. So, it is quite obvious to expect a lot from this release. The main highlights in GNOME 3.30 include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;GNOME 3.30 has fixed some critical memory leak issues. This has helped the project to make it’s footprint smaller. With the improved resource usage, we can now run multiple application without affecting the performance.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Web application now enables the minimal view. With this, when reading some content, you can toggle the minimal view to give more focus on content rather than controls. The minimal view stripes out images and unnecessary parts from the web page and makes the content more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Boxes, the GNOME virtual machine application, can now connect to remote windows servers using the remote desktop protocol(RDP). This enables seamless integration with Windows servers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Games, the gaming application is faster now. It enables navigation with the gamepad and includes some new games.&lt;/li&gt;
