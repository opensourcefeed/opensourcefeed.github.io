This release comes with improved stability to provide a more reliable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dramatic improvements in various components &amp;amp; tasks such as OpenRC, boot speed, removable device management, SysAdm API integrations ..etc. The Lumina Desktop has also got several improvements since the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/post-images/trueos17.12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TrueOS 17.12 release banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes in the desktop release, the team was also working on TrueOS server edition. As a proof of this, the team has introduced a new text-based server image with support for Virtualization systems such as &lt;em&gt;bhyve&lt;/em&gt;. This server image also takes advantage of various improvements in FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the important highlights in TrueOS 17.12 release can be summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Over 1100 OpenRC services have been created for 3rd-party packages. This should ensure the functionality of nearly all available 3rd-party packages that install/use their own services.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The OpenRC services for FreeBSD itself have been overhauled, resulting in significantly shorter boot times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Separate install images for desktops and servers (server image uses a text/console installer). The server image provides support for Bhyve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FreeBSD base is synced with 12.0-CURRENT as of December 4th, 2017 (Github commit: 209d01f)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;FreeBSD ports tree is synced as of November 30th (pre-FLAVOR changes)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lumina Desktop has been updated/developed from 1.3.0 to 1.4.1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;PCDM now supports multiple simultaneous graphical sessions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Removable devices are now managed through the “automounter” service.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are “announced” as available to the system via .desktop shortcuts in /media. These shortcuts also contain a variety of optional “Actions” that may be performed on the device.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are only mounted while they are being used (such as when browsing via the command line or a file manager).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Devices are automatically unmounted as soon as they stop being accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Integrated support for all major filesystems (UFS, EXT, FAT, NTFS, ExFAT, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The TrueOS update system has moved to an “active” update backend. This means that the user will need to actually start the update process by clicking the “Update Now” button in SysAdm, Lumina, or PCDM (as well as the command-line option). The staging of the update files is still performed automatically by default but this (and many other options) can be easily changed in the “Update Manager” settings as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

Similar to previous releases, this release also brings 64 bit and 32 bit installation images. The 64 bit release provides complete support for UEFI systems and secure boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/peppermint8respin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peppermint 8 Respin banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a minor release in Peppermint 8 series, the &lt;em&gt;Respin&lt;/em&gt; release brings some package updates &amp;amp; bug fixes. Following are some significant changes introduced in Peppermint 8 Respin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nemo 3.4.7 - It seems more stable during large file operations, and now has a separate process for controlling the desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;OpenVPN updated in the repos to version OpenVPN 2.4.4 to support mixed mode IPv4/IPv6 VPN’s.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Switched from lightdm-gtk-greeter to slick-greeter, to provide a much simple and elegant login screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Added a desktop right-click “Open Peppermint Settings Panel” context menu item.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Installed mint-translations, so included mint applications are now available with non-English translations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fixed peppermint-proxy-configuration on the 32bit ISO.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improved i3lock lock-screen, similar to the previous one but with a neater looking clock that can be changed between 12hr and 24hr&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Advert Blocker reinstated by request, available in the main menu not in the Peppermint Settings Panel.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New &lt;em&gt;Peppirus&lt;/em&gt; icon theme &amp;amp; Gtk theme.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Changed default wallpaper to Peppermint-3D-Logo-Alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Three additional Ray Bilcliff wallpapers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disabled Gtk overlay scrollbars, so the scrollbars don’t overlay other window content making it difficult to see.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Repository now contain tweaked versions of screenfetch and neofetch with custom Peppermint logo ASCII art.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Slightly larger terminal window defaults so neofetch/screenfetch have the room necessary to display properly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Started adding non-English translated versions of ICE to the repos .. more languages will be added later as we create them (we’re putting in a lot of effort into having full non-English translations for ALL applications hopefully by Peppermint 9).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All other updates from Lubuntu 16.04.x LTS series.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lumina theme engine : It is a new component of the “core” desktop, and provides enhanced theming capabilities for the desktop as well as all Qt5 applications. While it started out life as a fork of the “qt5ct” utility, it quickly grew all sorts of new features and functionality such as system-defined color profiles, modular theme components, and built-in editors/creators for all components.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lumina PDF Viewer : This is a new, stand-alone desktop utility for viewing/printing/presenting PDF documents. It uses the poppler-qt5 library in the backend for rendering the document, but uses multi-threading in many ways (such as to speed up the loading of pages) to give the user a nice, streamlined utility for viewing PDF documents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korora team has already prepared a few experimental ISOs and has started working on layouts for various spins, and ISO testing is also in progress. Once everything is set, Korora 27 will be officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From official statement made by Korora team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For our next release, Korora 27, we have decided that the codename will be “Marlin” which continues the tradition of having codenames based on characters from “Finding Nemo”. The development on Korora 27 is in full progress, this involves fixing the layouts on a couple of our spins and of course building and testing iso’s which is done by the team. Once we are satisfied and everything works as should the final iso’s will be build, tested and released. For the upcoming release we are using Canvas to build, maintain our ISO’s and much more.
