This release comes with updated Linux Kernel and other applications. It also includes more consistent user experience with improved theming and other artworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/solus-3-iso-refresh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Solus 3 ISO refresh, a snap of different editions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently announced Solus 3 ISO refresh is identified by the version number 3.9999. It is available in all 3 official flavors of the Solus project, ie, Budgie, MATE and GNOME editions. Despite the edition chosen, Solus provides a consistent user experience across the entire system with the improved theming. It makes use of &lt;em&gt;Adapta&lt;/em&gt; for GTK theming and &lt;em&gt;Papirus&lt;/em&gt; for icon theming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solus 3.9999 brings Linux Kernel 4.18.5. It enables support for the recent CPUs from AMD and Intel. This includes the support for advanced technologies like high core count CPUs like AMD Threadripper 2. Additional hardware compatibility is enabled out-of-the-box by tuning kernel flags wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main changes in various Solus edition include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;: Removable Devices is extension is now enabled by default. It helps to mount/unmount partitions without opening Nautilus. The Nautilus is configured to open files and folders with a single click. Also, the thumbnail preview is enabled for network devices also. The search results in Nautilus have been limited to local in order to avoid performance delay.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATE&lt;/strong&gt;: A separator is added on the panel after the clock widget, to improve readability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solus 3.9999 brings a set of updated applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Firefox 62&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;LibreOffice 6.1.0.3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rhythmbox 3.4.2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Thunderbird 60&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GNOME MPV 0.14 in Budgie and GNOME editions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;VLC 3.0.3 in MATE edition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

This beta release is for curious technical users and 3rd party app developers to make their app working on Juno when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/elementary-Juno-beta-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;elementary Juno beta banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-juno&quot;&gt;What is new in Juno?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elementary Juno beta 2 release comes with a set of features and improvements that we can expect in the final release. The main changes in Juno beta2 release include,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The login screen and lock screen greeter is improved with better scaling on HiDPI screens. This is made possible with a simple compositor that provides things like shadows beneath the shutdown window and indicators. The indicator works more consistently on the desktop and on the login screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There have been multiple issue fixes in AppCenter. Banners on the home screen will have a glow on hover, based on the band color. Some old CSS styles were removed from the theme. These styles were required for pre-Gtk.3.20 release. elementary Juno uses Gtk 3.22.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Thumbnail in &lt;em&gt;Files&lt;/em&gt;, the elementary file manager, has been improved to show consistent thumbnails.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The stylesheet now provides an “inline” style for tab bars. This means if an app opts into this style, its tabs can better match the content they’re switching between instead of always being chrome-colored.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Music&lt;/em&gt; app has got multiple issues fixes to make it more stable. There is no visual improvement between beta 1 and beta 2, but there has been a rigor code cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There has been a lot of code cleanup and refinement into the far reaches of Photos. Most of it is not user-visible, but you might notice that almost all of the dialogs have been cleaned up and made more consistent with the rest of the elementary apps thanks to being moved to Granite.MessageDialog.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt; has UI improvements across the board, which make it look cleaner and be able to tile down to smaller sizes. A new inline tab bar style is introduced in the stylesheet across all three color schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manipulating the display settings is now more accurate with the Settings App. Now, this configurations is a lot more natural, especially in multiscreen setup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is a stable release of Debian based GNU/Linux distribution with &lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Window Manager&lt;/em&gt;. The Elive 3.0 is released on occasion of the eighth anniversary of the project. Samuel claims Elive 3.0 as the most stable release among the releases published so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/elive3.0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview Elive 3.0 Desktop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-is-delayed-but-worth-to-try&quot;&gt;It is delayed, but worth to try!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elive 3.0 is based on Debian 8.x &lt;em&gt;Jessy&lt;/em&gt; branch. It is very late for a distribution to announce its first release based on Jessy. Most of the packages shipped in this release are quite outdated now. Mr. Samuel has justified the delay with the lack of contributors. Despite the outdated packages, he promises a rock solid, useful and beautiful system out of Elive 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elive-also-launches-a-new-website&quot;&gt;Elive also launches a new website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Elive 3.0, the project has also rolled an updated website with a modern look and feel. This website presents the purpose and features of Elive Linux in a very vivid manner. You can visit the Elive website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elivecd.org/&quot;&gt;https://www.elivecd.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After 8 years of silent development, the third stable version of Elive is out, the result is simply amazing and the integration is gorgeous, it is not even possible to describe every inside feature and the new website only contains a small portion of its characteristics.
Unfortunately not everything is rainbows and perfection, the lack of resources made the release being too much delayed, and this lead to old packages and drivers, but despite that, the final result is really worth it, Elive 3.0 is the most useful system ever made, perfect for the daily use, rock solid, beautiful and full of hidden features, with every simplified aspect to make it usable for any user level.
If all this was not enough this version is the most powerful version, maintaining its lightness in resources and blazing fast responsiveness, do not hesitate to put this polished and ready to use the operating system in every computer for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

In certain parts of the world, mobile is the most common platform used to access the internet. While there are a lot of surveillance projects to track the mobile Internet usage. This is a serious question against individual privacy and anonymity. The tor project is working on this issue for a while. So, we have Tor Browser for Android now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/tor-for-android.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview of Tor Browser for Android&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor project has announced the availability of Tor Browser for Android alpha release. This is the first time Tor project introducing the browser for Android. Presently, there is &lt;em&gt;Orfox&lt;/em&gt;, a browser that routes network through &lt;em&gt;Orbot&lt;/em&gt;. This project will be decommissioned once the Tor browser hits the stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor Browser alpha release is available on Google Play Store. The APK is also available directly from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha&quot;&gt;Tor website&lt;/a&gt;. Presently, the Tor Browser for Android requires Orbot to establish the connection through the Tor network. The final stable release will eliminate the dependency of Orbot, and users can directly browse with Tor Browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of Tor Browser for Android can be summarized as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BLOCK TRACKERS: Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can’t follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you’re done browsing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE: Prevent someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you’re using Tor.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;RESIST FINGERPRINTING: Tor aims to make all users look the same, so Tor Browser for Android makes it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION: When you use Tor Browser for Android, your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. Watch this animation to learn more about how it works.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;BROWSE FREELY: With Tor Browser for Android, you are free to access sites your local internet service provider may have blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

It is a result of 6 months of development effort by the GNOME community and includes major new features and smaller stability and performance improvements. A number of community developers around the world has helped to make this release possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/gnome3.30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A preview of GNOME Desktop 3.30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;With the improved performance, GNOME 3.30 can run multiple applications simultaneously, without affecting performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GNOME 3.30 is named as Almeria, as a recognition to the GUADEC organizing team at Almeria, Spain. GUADEC is an annual conference of GNOME developers and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new-in-gnome-330&quot;&gt;What is new in GNOME 3.30?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME 3.30 is a major release from popular open source desktop environment. So, it is quite obvious to expect a lot from this release. The main highlights in GNOME 3.30 include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GNOME 3.30 has fixed some critical memory leak issues. This has helped the project to make it’s footprint smaller. With the improved resource usage, we can now run multiple application without affecting the performance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GNOME 3.30 makes screen sharing and remote desktop session easier. An indicator is added to the system menu to quickly monitor the status of the connection and to disconnect when required.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The GNOME Software now includes the option to enable/disable automatic update of flatpak applications.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Web application now enables the minimal view. With this, when reading some content, you can toggle the minimal view to give more focus on content rather than controls.
