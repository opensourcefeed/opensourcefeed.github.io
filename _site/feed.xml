&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For our next release, Korora 27, we have decided that the codename will be “Marlin” which continues the tradition of having codenames based on characters from “Finding Nemo”. The development on Korora 27 is in full progress, this involves fixing the layouts on a couple of our spins and of course building and testing iso’s which is done by the team. Once we are satisfied and everything works as should the final iso’s will be build, tested and released. For the upcoming release we are using Canvas to build, maintain our ISO’s and much more.

This was owing to some serious booting issues found in arm64 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that, the resolution for currently detected issue will require pulling kernel leve changes and flash kernel. Eventhough this can be completed within the scheduled time, there won’t be enough time available for testing which will raise a concern over stability of the release. Considering the seriousness of issue, &lt;em&gt;Mr Adam Cornard&lt;/em&gt; from Ubuntu release engineering team has agreed to postpone the release till February 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find these mail threads in Ubuntu &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2017-January/004015.html&quot;&gt;release mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hi Adam (and the Release Team),
&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to formally request an extension for 16.04.2's release.  We
have just identified a serious boot regression on arm64.  The resolution
looks to require landing changes to the kernel, flash-kernel, and possibly
d-i.  While we can likely physically get those changes into the archive in
time for the release, there would be next to no time to test this nor
provide appropriate regression testing on other platforms. We would be much
more comfortable giving that some proper testing before releasing and
therefore would like to request an additional extension for the point
release date.  Thoughts?  We will honor whatever guidance we receive from
you.
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,
Leann

I'm a big fan of caution when it comes to the bits that make people's
computers either boot or completely fail to, as it's pretty hard to fix
boot errors after shipping them.  So, yes, a delay for a week while all
this is landed and tested seems entirely reasonable to me.  Will push
the release to Feb 9 instead.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In LibreOffice 5.3, Writer has some great new features to make your documents shine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table styles are now supported, letting you apply formatting to a table which is preserved when you make edits to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Page deck in the sidebar lets you quickly customise page settings without having to go through a separate dialog box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For faster navigation, a new Go to Page box lets you jump to another page in the document with just a few keypresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the drawing tools, arrows that were previously only available in Draw and Impress can now be used in Writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, the toolbar includes a new Small Capitals button, and this formatting can also be applied via macros.&lt;/li&gt;
