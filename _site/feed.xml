&lt;p&gt;Korora team has already prepared a few experimental ISOs and has started working on layouts for various spins, and ISO testing is also in progress. Once everything is set, Korora 27 will be officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From official statement made by Korora team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For our next release, Korora 27, we have decided that the codename will be “Marlin” which continues the tradition of having codenames based on characters from “Finding Nemo”. The development on Korora 27 is in full progress, this involves fixing the layouts on a couple of our spins and of course building and testing iso’s which is done by the team. Once we are satisfied and everything works as should the final iso’s will be build, tested and released. For the upcoming release we are using Canvas to build, maintain our ISO’s and much more.

This was owing to some serious booting issues found in arm64 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that, the resolution for currently detected issue will require pulling kernel leve changes and flash kernel. Eventhough this can be completed within the scheduled time, there won’t be enough time available for testing which will raise a concern over stability of the release. Considering the seriousness of issue, &lt;em&gt;Mr Adam Cornard&lt;/em&gt; from Ubuntu release engineering team has agreed to postpone the release till February 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hi Adam (and the Release Team),
&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to formally request an extension for 16.04.2's release.  We
have just identified a serious boot regression on arm64.  The resolution
looks to require landing changes to the kernel, flash-kernel, and possibly
d-i.  While we can likely physically get those changes into the archive in
time for the release, there would be next to no time to test this nor
provide appropriate regression testing on other platforms. We would be much
more comfortable giving that some proper testing before releasing and
therefore would like to request an additional extension for the point
release date.  Thoughts?  We will honor whatever guidance we receive from
you.
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,
Leann
&lt;br /&gt;

I'm a big fan of caution when it comes to the bits that make people's
computers either boot or completely fail to, as it's pretty hard to fix
boot errors after shipping them.  So, yes, a delay for a week while all
this is landed and tested seems entirely reasonable to me.  Will push
the release to Feb 9 instead.
&lt;br /&gt;

It integrates most up-to-date
KDE Plasma desktop and other KDE community developed applications on stable base of Ubuntu LTS (Long Term
Supported) releases. While the core remains the same (LTS release of Ubuntu), the KDE components get
contineous updates to provide most modern KDE technologies to the end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/neon_a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Preview of KDE neon Desktop&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Courtesy : Linux.com portal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Linux.com&lt;/em&gt; portal has published a review on KDE neon project which observes that, the project a 
success for providing an almost perfect desktop environment to the end users. The review begins by 
stating that, the user interest has dramatically moved away from KDE project over the years. Plasma 3
was able to attract a lot of users owing to it’s simplcity and traditional user experience. However, Plasma 4
made the system more heavy and was not that responsive. Plasma 5 was able to overcome limitations of 
Plasma 4 by making system more responsive and resource efficient. Still it was lagging behind due to
sticking with a traditional desktop metaphor and the desktop was buggy on most of the platforms. The
KDE neon project was started to show-off how well, KDE Plasma desktop can be integrated with a GNU/Linux
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the review, KDE neon provides a smooth Plasma experience to the end users. The project is
integrating a nice flat theme, and it is very stable and fast comparing to KDE Plasma 4. The widget management
has also becomes much easier. However, there are some rough edges like, lack of commonly used applications
like office suites and somewhat outdated packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To recover a bit of that lost ground, the KDE developers opted to fork Ubuntu into KDE Neon. The launch of Neon didn’t quite go as planned (and the initial release wasn’t exactly stable). Since then, however, the project has managed to pull off something quite intriguing. KDE Neon takes the stability of Ubuntu 16.04 and applies a cutting-edge release of the KDE desktop to create an absolutely beautiful experience, that could easily appease those looking for the best of both worlds.

&lt;p&gt;Newly announced Bodhi Linux 4.1.0 features updated packages like EFL 1.18.4, and updated version of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, Linux Kernel 4.8 which comes with improved support for different graphics cards, and a new Moksha desktop theme inspired by Arc Dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing users of Bodhi Linux 4.x, can avail all the bug fixes by a simple system update. But they need to take manual actions for changing linux kernel and to use updated dark theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This release serves to package up the fixes for a few bugs that slipped through the cracks in the 4.0.0 release, as well as provided updated package sets for the install ISO images. Most notably these ISO images come with EFL 1.18.4, Linux Kernel 4.8, and a new Moksha Theme based on the “Arc Dark” theme. Existing Bodhi 4.0.0 users already have the bug fixes incorporated into these ISO images, but they will need to manually install the newer kernel and theme if they wish to utilize them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This release includes numerous changes on underlying components and comes with better application support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wine is basically a compatibly layer for running windows binary executables on different POSIX compliant platforms like GNU/Linux, BSD and macOS. WINE is not a mere emulator, instead it maps windows system calls into native system calls on real time and hence provide better performance than an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/wine banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;WINE banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main highlight of WINE 2.0 is support for MS Office 2013, new office suite published by Microsoft Corporation and 64 bit application support in macOS operating system. It took almost one complete year to finish development of WINE 2.0 and it includes around 6,600 individual revisions after previous release. These revisoins provides support for a lot of new games and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINE 2.0 is first stable release in revised annual release plan for the project. When a release is published strict annual basis, there can be space for some incomplete changes and WINE 2.0 is not and exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    This release represents over a year of development effort and around 6,600 individual changes. The main highlights are the support for Microsoft Office 2013, and the 64-bit support on macOS.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    It also contains a lot of improvements across the board, as well as support for many new applications and games. See the release notes below for a summary of the major changes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    This is the first release made on the new time-based, annual release schedule. This implies that some features that are being worked on but couldn't be finished in time have been deferred to the next development cycle. This includes in particular the Direct3D command stream, the full HID support, the Android graphics driver, and message-mode pipes.
