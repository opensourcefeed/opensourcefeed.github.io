Debian 9 Stretch Installer rc1. This release is coming after several alpha releases and 
can expect improved stability and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release of Debian installer reverts the switch to merge /usr as the default configuration 
of debootstrap as it raises a number of serious issues which might not be fixed in time 
for stretch. In next release cycle, this configuration will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous Alpha release (Alpha 6) Debian Pure Blends appeared in Software selection 
screen. There were some different opinions regarding this. How ever, it was n’t addressed 
during the freeze as freeze is not the phase where critical screens are expected to revamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some improvements made in this development release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apt-setup

&lt;li&gt;cdebconf-terminal:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from ttf-dejavu-mono-udeb to fonts-dejavu-mono-udeb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debian-installer:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Add HTTPS support through new ca-certificates and wget udebs&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from ttf-dejavu-udeb to fonts-dejavu-udeb.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch from fonts-lklug-sinhala to fonts-noto-hinted-udeb for Sinhala&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Bump Linux kernel version from 4.7.0-1 to 4.8.0-2.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Update theme to softWaves by Juliette Belin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debian-installer-utils:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Add checksum verification to fetch-url.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;espeakup-udeb:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Avoid issues with sound board names containing spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Fix race conditions when starting espeakup.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Switch to espeak-ng (#833658).

This release includes some security fixes and resolutions for other critical issues reported in previous snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debian 8.7 is not a new release, instead an updated snapshot with updated packages. This is just a continuation of snapshots in Debian 8.x series. So you can install any other snapshot in this release and update your system using regular update means to get all upgraded packages and bug fixes as in 8.7 snapshot.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/Debian Banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Debian Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    The Debian project is pleased to announce the seventh update of its stable distribution Debian 8 (codename &quot;jessie&quot;). This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories were already published separately and are referenced where available.

    Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian 8 but only updates some of the packages included. There is no need to throw away old &quot;jessie&quot; CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to be updated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170114&quot;&gt;release announcement&lt;/a&gt; and detailed list of security fixes, see Debian website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Debian - The Universal Operating System developers has announced release of Debian 8.7, 7th updated snapshot in Debian 8.x Jessy branch.

It makes use of best tools and technologies from both distributions. In terms of resource usage, it is expected to be a midweight(somewhere between lightweight and heavy distributions) which combines a beautiful and efficient &lt;a href=&quot;/desktop/xfce&quot;&gt;Xfce desktop&lt;/a&gt; with 
Debian to provide a highly stable, solid operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest release of distrowatch weekly dated 9th January 2017, features a review of MX Linux 16 as cover story. The review concludes that, the developers of MX Linux were able to keep a fair balance between performance and elegance. The distribution is lightweight, highly responsive with modern technologies. However, the reviewer does not recommend MX Linux for absolute newbies as it expects some kind of prior Linux experience to play with. Though it is a good choice for people with outdated computers and people who care the most about performance and resource usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like that while MX is light on resources, it provides a lot of popular software for us to use. We are treated to good multimedia support, a full featured productivity suite and web browser. The software included in MX is more modern than Debian Stable and we have access to a Backports repository if we want to access up to date applications.

I ran into just a few rough edges, like the theme changer asking me to restart Firefox and the update manager not refreshing its package information before downloading new updates. Earlier I mentioned some frustration with the many overlapping configuration tools, but I acknowledge what I see as clutter could be another person's convenience. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This release ships numerous games of reasonable quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Edition 5.0 Gamers is mainly targeting hard core gamers and you may not find it pretty as the regular releases. During the development, Theehman and Mcginnis has worked hard to strip down the OS to the core and then various packages were included to serve the needs of a gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/post-images/ultimate-edition720x340.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ultimate Edition Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gamers OS gives optimal performance when it is installed and some of the games shipped will require heavy data download (upto 5 GB) and proprietary graphical drivers. While some other games are very simple and can run without special graphic card drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don’t typically have time to play games, that may change in the future. With a AMD RyZen CPU &amp;amp; Vega GPU on my Itinerary. Both free, I will sell AMD stock to get both for free. I paid 0 for the stock is how it is free. Let me try and queue you in. I convinced a co-worker to invest in AMD back when it was $6.97 a share November 21st I believe at $30,000 (4,043 shares). I did not ask for money. He offered me 2 days later $5,000 for the tip. I turned it down. I wanted stock. I have stock in AMD. I know where they are going. As a bonus to him I will tell him when to sell.

&lt;p&gt;The dedoimedo portal has published a review on Maui Linux 2.1. Throughout the review, a positive experience is being presented though with some minor fall backs. The review travels through different aspects of the system and presents positive remarks like less resource utilization without compromising performance and responsiveness, reasonable battery life, a working package management front-end, ie synaptic, which may not be liked by new users, a nice choice of applications, fair amount of customization to offer a familiar experience and good hardware support. Also, some rough edges are figured out like, printer support, slower update process and few other cosmetic glitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maui Linux 2.1 Blue Tang is a surprisingly and yet expectedly good Plasma system, using some of that Mint-like approach to home computing. It's what Kubuntu should have been or should be, and it delivers a practical, out-of-the-box experience with a fine blend of software, fun and stability. That's a very sensible approach.

Not everything was perfect. Plasma has its bugs, the printer and the web cam issues need to be looked into, and on the aesthetics side, a few things can be polished and improved. The installer can benefit from having some extra safety mechanisms. But I guess that is the sum of my complaints. On the happy side, you get all the goodies from the start, the application collection is rich, the distro did not crash, and the performance is really decent for a Plasma beastling. A fine formula, and probably the best one we've seen in the last eighteen months or so.

&lt;p&gt;KaOS team is delivering first snapshot in 2017 with fresh and cool look. It comes with updated version of Midna artwork, which mainly includes inclusion of sddm theme that employs a layered QML model. This will ease the task of selecting between default Plasma session and wayland session. Also, the system panel is moved to right side with vertical orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notable major updates to the base of the system are Boost 1.62.0, ICU 58.2, Ruby 2.4.0, Systemd 232, FFMPEG 3.2, Linux 4.8.15, Mesa 13.0.2, Hunspell 1.6.0, Gpgme 1.8.0, Gstreamer 1.10.2 and a move to Openjpeg 2 (2.1.2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;New is the use of a GUI warning on system updates that require user action. Adding such notices to a News item or having an install message included in (at time large) pacman output is too easily missed. A rolling distribution will have to make such changes over the lifetime of an install. Thus the need for a better way to communicate is now implemented, see an example for the upcoming OpenVPN update for all users.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
