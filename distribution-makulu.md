**MakuluLinux** is a unique GNU/Linux distribution built on top of a custom Debian Foundation. It always surprises users and reviewers with their design decisions.

As per the developer's claim, *Makulu does not simply take a Debian release and then add some themes & tools to publish another distribution. Instead, they have put a lot of effort to build an optimized custom base with Makulu & Debian repositories. All the Makulu releases are evolved from this foundation*.

There are 3 official varieties for MakuluLinux. *Makulu Core* provides a clear vision of Makulu releases with custom Xfce Desktop and beauty. *Makulu Flash* is a traditional-looking release with a focus on ease-of-use, stability, and performance. *Makulu Lindoz* provides a familiar experience for users from Windows background, but it does not try to mimic the theme and color scheme of Windows.
