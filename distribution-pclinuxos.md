**PCLinuxOS** is an independently evolved, rolling GNU/Linux distribution started back in 2004. Initially, it was started as a fork of Mandriva Linux. Over the years, it has become a full-fledged GNU/Linux distribution rolling its packages and has secured a significant position among well-known GNU/Linux distributions.

PCLinuxOS comes with the caption *So cool, Ice cubes are jealous*. It tries to use the best of all known technologies. As proof of this, PCLinuxOS is using RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) packages, while it is integrated with APT and Synaptic from Debian world for package management.

PCLinuxOS is conservative in terms of look and feel. It maintains a traditional aesthetic feel while rolling updated packages and the latest and greatest applications.
