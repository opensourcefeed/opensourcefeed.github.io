## Highlights of Zorin OS 18 Beta

  Zorin OS 18 debuts a sleeker, more rounded interface with translucent backgrounds, two new theme colours (Yellow and Brown), and a floating rounded panel for a more modern look.

  Connect your Microsoft 365 account in “Online Accounts” to access your OneDrive files directly from the file manager sidebar.
- **Updated base system**  
  Powered by Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS with Linux kernel 6.14, Zorin OS 18 Beta brings updated drivers, PipeWire audio, and improved hardware support.
- **Better Windows compatibility**  
  Enhanced detection of Windows installer files with guidance on running or replacing them, easing migration from Windows.
