## Python 3.12: Default Interpreter

Python 3.12 is now the default, replacing older versions. This upgrade addresses longstanding issues with pip’s lack of environment isolation by introducing **pipx** as a safer alternative. This ensures a consistent and secure environment for Python package management.

For guidance, refer to the [Installing Python Applications via pipx](https://www.kali.org/docs).


## The End of i386 Kernel and Images

Kali Linux bids farewell to 32-bit x86 kernel images but retains support for i386 packages. These packages can still run on 64-bit systems using tools like Docker or the APT package manager. If you rely on i386 binaries, the Kali community is available via the [bug tracker](https://bugs.kali.org) to provide assistance.


## SSH Client: Phasing Out DSA Keys

The OpenSSH 9.8p1 update officially deprecates DSA keys. For legacy systems requiring SSH1 protocol, the `ssh1` client (OpenSSH v7.5) is now included. Configure legacy compatibility using the **kali-tweaks** tool. For more detailed documentation, visit the [SSH Client Guide](https://www.kali.org/docs/ssh).


## Raspberry Pi Imager Customizations

Raspberry Pi enthusiasts rejoice! Kali images now support **Raspberry Pi Imager Customizations**, allowing users to configure usernames, passwords, Wi-Fi settings, and SSH keys before the first boot. However, this feature excludes PiTail images.

**Pro Tip**: Secure your system by deleting configuration files from the `/boot` partition after the first boot.


## GNOME 47: Visual Enhancements

The new GNOME 47 desktop update includes:

> - **Accent Color Customization**: Personalize window and shell widgets.
- **New Login Theme**: A refreshed, cohesive visual experience.
- **System Monitor Extension**: Enhanced resource monitoring.
- **Improved Color Schemes**: Better readability in GNOME Text Editor.


## Kali Forums Refresh

The new **Discourse-powered Kali Forums** offer an upgraded space for discussions, powered by contributions from community moderators. Check it out [here](https://forums.kali.org).


## 14 New Tools Added

Kali continues to expand its arsenal with the addition of 14 tools, including:

> - **bloodyad**: Active Directory privilege escalation framework.
- **hexwalk**: Hex analyzer, editor, and viewer.
- **xsrfprobe**: Advanced CSRF audit toolkit.
- **zenmap**: The Network Mapper front end.
