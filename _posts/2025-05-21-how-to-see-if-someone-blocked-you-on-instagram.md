**We** all have that "one that got away", and depending on whether you ended it on good or bad terms, you may have no access to their life anymore. Sometimes, however, nostalgia gets the best of you, and you pull up their IG account to see what they have been up to lately. If you ended on bad terms, or they are just the kind of person to leave bygones in the past, they may have blocked you from seeing their content.

In this article, we'll explore how to tell for sure if you've been blocked or if they just deleted their account. If the former is true, we'll also explore how to view their content anyway using <a href="https://profiledownload.org/"  rel="nofollow">Instagram Profile Downloader</a>.

## How to See If You Are Blocked on Instagram

Here are some of the ways you can tell if someone blocked you on Insta:

### Search Their Profile on Instagram

If you want to know whether someone blocked you on Instagram, perform a quick search of their profile. If they have a public profile and you can see their posts, then you've not been blocked. If their account is private and you see the message _"This account is private"_, then you've also not been blocked. Chances are, if you were following them before, they just revoked your access as a follower. 

However, if you see the profile and the number of posts they have, but the posts don't show up in the grid display area, then they've blocked you. If your search does not bring up their profile at all, then they may have deactivated or deleted their account.

### Check Your Tagged Photos

Even after someone blocks you, you can still see photos they had tagged you in or old comments they had made on your posts. Navigate to their profile from these comments or tagged photos. Much like in the first method, if you can see their post count with no photos or videos in the display, then they've blocked you.

### Use Your Browser

Though Instagram is by and large a mobile app, you can access any IG profile by keying in the URL `instagram.com/username` on any browser. If you're logged in to your IG account on said browser, you'll see an error message saying:

> _"Sorry, this page isn't available"_

if they've blocked you. Granted, this will also be the case if the account has been deleted or deactivated.

### Check Your Direct Messages

If you'd previously shared DMs with the person you suspect has blocked you, navigate to your message thread. If you still see the chat, you're probably in the clear. If you want to be sure that the person has not just deactivated or deleted their account, check any groups you may have in common to see if they are listed as a member. If you still see them as a participant in the group but can't see your DM thread with them, then they've blocked you.

### Try Following Them Again

If your target revoked you as a follower, attempt to follow them again if the situation allows. If they've blocked you, your follow request will not be sent, and clicking the button will have no effect. Fortunately, they won't get notified that you tried to follow them.

### Use Another Instagram Account

For avoidance of doubt, this is the most foolproof way to determine whether someone has you blocked on IG. If searching their profile from a friend's account brings up all their posts but the search from your account yields no posts, then you've been blocked. 

## How to View IG Profiles That Have Blocked You

Being blocked essentially restricts you from viewing the person's IG profile. What if I told you there was a way to view their content even with this block in effect? Enter â€“ **Instagram Profile Downloader**.

### Instagram Profile Downloader

**Instagram Profile Downloader** is a robust platform that helps you view and save stories, highlights, and reels from a public or private account without any loss of quality. The platform saves IG content from the tracked account for up to three months in your user space. This means you can view stories long after their 24-hour expiry has lapsed, and even access content the creator may have deleted.

Interestingly, you get to do all this completely anonymously, as the account owner will never know you viewed their content. 

### How to Use the Instagram Profile Downloader

Here's how to view and download private Instagram profiles using our downloader tool:

1. **Select whether the account you wish to track is public or private.**  
   Click the "Try Now" button on the Instagram Profile Downloader website. This will prompt you to choose whether the account you wish to view is public or private.

2. **Paste your target's username in the search bar.**  
   On the ensuing search bar, paste the username or URL of the account you wish to monitor. Click on "Watch" to begin tracking.

3. **Choose a subscription plan.**  
   You'll need to register using a valid email address and choose your preferred subscription plan. Complete the purchase and await an email with further instructions.

4. **Allow the platform some time to retrieve data.**  
   Once you complete the setup, allow the service to retrieve data from IG. In a short while, you'll see all their profile information on an intuitive dashboard. Here, you can view and save content at will. 

## Conclusion

Instagram allows users to block others from viewing their profile or accessing their content. If you've been blocked, Instagram won't notify you of it.
