One of the noteworthy highlight coming with Fedora 34 is redesigned logo - made by the Fedora Design team accepting the suggestions and feedback from the community. This redesigned logo fixes several *technical* issues related with the previous logo.

## What's new in Fedora 34?
> - Fedora 34 Workstation features GNOME 40, a redesigned - and mostly rewritten release of GNOME. GNOME 40 brings a redesigned activities overview and enhancements to other core components. It offers a distraction free computing experience with well planned design. [Read what's new in GNOME 40](https://www.opensourcefeed.org/gnome-40-release/).
- After introducing Brtfs as the default file system in Fedora 33, Fedora 34 implements transparent compression to optimize disk usage. This compression will improve read/write time for larger files, and thus increases the time efficiency.
