**Wallpaper** is the first piece of artwork that catches the attention of an average computer user. For an operating system, it is important to have a good looking wallpaper if it is oriented towards beginners.

As a distribution focusing on beginners and advanced users, Fedora ships a decent default wallpaper with each release. It also provides an additional set of wallpapers to choose from.

Let's take a quick journey through the default wallpapers of Fedora, beginning from Fedora Core 1.
