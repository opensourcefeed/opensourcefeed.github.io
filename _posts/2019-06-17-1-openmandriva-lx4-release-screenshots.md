**The** *OpenMandriva Association* has announced the release of OpenMandriva Lx 4.0. It includes several visible changes and under the hood improvements.

OpenMandriva is a GNU/Linux distribution compiled using optimization features of LLVM/Clang. The main highlights of OpenMandriva Lx 4.0 includes,
- Plasma 5.15.5 along with updated KDE applications and KDE Framework.
- The LibreOffice suite now provides better integration with Plasma eco-system.
- Falkon web browser is the default browser in this release. It uses same engine as Google Chrome, while consumes less memory.
- MP3 encoders/decoders are included in default installation as the problematic license is expired. Also, video players have been updated.
- The OpenMandriva Welcome application is updated with a lot of customization options.
