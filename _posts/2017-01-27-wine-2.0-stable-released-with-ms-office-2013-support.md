**Finally** the WINE (recursive acronym for Wine Is Not Emulator) developers has announced availability of Wine 2.0 stable release. This release includes numerous changes on underlying components and comes with better application support.

Wine is basically a compatibly layer for running windows binary executables on different POSIX compliant platforms like GNU/Linux, BSD and macOS. WINE is not a mere emulator, instead it maps windows system calls into native system calls on real time and hence provide better performance than an emulator.
