With the introduction of the Plasma Edition, Sous now supports 4 different desktop environments, Budgie, MATE, GNOME, and Plasma. All these 4 editions share common Solus principles but provide alternative user experiences. It is expected that the option to choose from different desktop environments will make Solus acceptable for more users.

The main highlights of Solus 4.1 *Fortitude* are briefed below.
