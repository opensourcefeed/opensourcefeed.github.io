**MX Linux** is a Debian stable based GNU/Linux distribution grown as a cooperative venture between the antiX and retired MEPIS communities. It makes use of best tools and technologies from both distributions. In terms of resource usage, it is expected to be a midweight(somewhere between lightweight and heavy distributions) which combines a beautiful and efficient [Xfce desktop](/desktop/xfce) with 
Debian to provide a highly stable, solid operating system.

Latest release of distrowatch weekly dated 9th January 2017, features a review of MX Linux 16 as cover story. The review concludes that, the developers of MX Linux were able to keep a fair balance between performance and elegance. The distribution is lightweight, highly responsive with modern technologies. However, the reviewer does not recommend MX Linux for absolute newbies as it expects some kind of prior Linux experience to play with. Though it is a good choice for people with outdated computers and people who care the most about performance and resource usage.

<blockquote>
I like that while MX is light on resources, it provides a lot of popular software for us to use. We are treated to good multimedia support, a full featured productivity suite and web browser. The software included in MX is more modern than Debian Stable and we have access to a Backports repository if we want to access up to date applications.

I ran into just a few rough edges, like the theme changer asking me to restart Firefox and the update manager not refreshing its package information before downloading new updates. Earlier I mentioned some frustration with the many overlapping configuration tools, but I acknowledge what I see as clutter could be another person's convenience.
