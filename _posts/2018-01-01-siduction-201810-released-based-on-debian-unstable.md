Sidcution 2018.1.0 comes in various flavors. The desktop flavors include KDE, LXQt, GNOME, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, Xorg, and noX. Currently, GNOME, MATE & LXDE flavors and largely unmaintained. Depending on the availability of volunteers, these flavors may be discontinued in future.

Quoting from [original release announcement for Siduction 2018.1.0](https://news.siduction.org/2017/12/release-notes-for-siduction-2018-1-0/):
> KDE Plasma stands at version 5.10.5, while GNOME comes in at 3.26 with
> some packages still at 3.24. LXQt ships at 0.12.0 and Xfce at 4.12.4, while
> Cinnamon comes in at 3.4.6 and MATE at 1.18.3. Sadly, right now, GNOME,
> MATE and LXDE are largely unmaintained. If no one steps up to keep them in a releasable state, we might have to drop these flavors with our next release. The corresponding packages will stay in the archives.

> This release comes with the name “patience 2018.1.0”. How we deal with
> this in the future is unclear. The next release, which might be there in March, in advance of CLT 2018, will ship whatever we come up with. Maybe it’ll be just numbered…
