With **Windows 10 reaching end-of-life**, millions of older PCs can no longer upgrade to Windows 11. Zorin OS 18 offers a perfect alternative — allowing you to keep your hardware while upgrading your computing experience. It’s a secure, modern, and user-friendly system built on a solid Linux foundation.

## What’s New in Zorin OS 18

The **Zorin OS 18 release** introduces a refreshed interface, enhanced productivity tools, deeper cloud integration, and improved app compatibility. It’s a major step forward for users looking for a clean, fast, and familiar desktop.

### A Refreshed Look and Feel

Zorin OS 18 features a sleek, rounded design with subtle transparency and a floating taskbar. The new workspace indicator helps you navigate tasks easily, while updates to the Files, Settings, and Calendar apps improve usability and clarity.

The **Camera app** now has a cleaner interface, and **Evolution Mail** offers a modern look that blends with the system theme. Every part of the interface reflects Zorin’s focus on simplicity and balance.

### Powerful Window Tiling and Productivity Enhancements

The new **advanced window tiling manager** makes multitasking effortless. Drag a window to the top of the screen, and a layout grid appears — letting you choose how to arrange your workspace without complex shortcuts.  
You can also create custom layouts, enable smart window suggestions, and use auto-tiling to manage multiple apps efficiently.

### Seamless Cloud and Web App Integration

Zorin OS 18 improves how you interact with web and cloud-based tools. The **Web Apps** tool lets you turn any website into a desktop app — perfect for Microsoft 365, Google Docs, or Adobe Photoshop. These apps integrate with your system menu and behave like native software.

Zorin OS 18 also adds **OneDrive integration**, so you can access cloud files directly in the Files app. This makes the system more familiar for users migrating from Windows.

### Expanded App Alternatives and Personalisation

To make switching easier, Zorin OS 18 detects over 170 Windows installers and suggests native or web-based Linux alternatives. For instance, when launching a Microsoft Office installer, Zorin directs you to the best compatible app or a native substitute.

New **theme colours** — Yellow and Brown — offer more ways to personalise your desktop. Zorin OS 18 Pro adds three new layouts inspired by **Linux Mint** and **elementary OS**, giving you even more control over your workspace.

### New Apps in Pro and Education Editions

**Zorin OS 18 Pro** introduces several new apps designed for professionals:

- **Deskflow**: Share your keyboard and mouse between multiple computers.  
- **Warp**: Transfer files easily between devices or across the internet.  
- **Valot**: Track time and earnings for freelance projects.  
- **Easy Effects**: Fine-tune audio with advanced sound tools.

**Zorin OS 18 Education** adds tools for learning and teaching:

- **Gradebook** for tracking academic performance.  
- **Spedread** for faster reading.  
- **TurboWarp**, a faster, enhanced Scratch-based programming tool for kids.

### Performance, Compatibility, and Long-Term Support

Zorin OS 18 includes major performance improvements and **WINE 10** support for running more Windows-native apps and games. Audio is handled by **PipeWire** for better sound quality and lower latency.  

Other highlights include:

- **Remote login with RDP** for easy remote access.  
- **Improved touchscreen and multi-monitor support.**  
- **New wallpapers and system sounds.**  
- **Expanded hardware compatibility.**

Zorin OS 18 will receive updates and support until **June 2029**, making it ideal for personal and business deployments.
