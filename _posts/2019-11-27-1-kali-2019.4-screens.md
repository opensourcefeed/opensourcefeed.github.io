**On** 26th November 2019, the Kali Linux team has announced the release of Kali Linux 2019.4. This release is different from the previous releases because of multiple reasons. One of the most visible improvements in Kali 2019.4 release is a well themed Xfce Desktop.

## The UI Revamp
The Kali Linux team was planning to have a major UI change for quite some time. The existing GNOME Desktop environment is **too much functional** and is not something that people are looking in a distribution like Kali. Also, the team has to work on a completely different layout for ARM systems.

By introducing the Xfce Desktop environment, Kali Linux provides an out-of-the-box functional desktop environment. It is not too much of resource hungry and can provide a consistent and smooth experience in lower specification systems and high-end computers.

The Kali Linux team also brings an eye candy theme for the Xfce Desktop. It also provides an undercover mode, which if enabled, your desktop will look like Microsoft Windows and you can continue to work on your *hacking* activities without giving doubt to the people around.
