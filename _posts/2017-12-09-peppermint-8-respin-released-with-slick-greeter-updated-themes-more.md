Being a minor release in Peppermint 8 series, the *Respin* release brings some package updates & bug fixes. Following are some significant changes introduced in Peppermint 8 Respin. 
> * Nemo 3.4.7 - It seems more stable during large file operations, and now has a separate process for controlling the desktop.
> * OpenVPN updated in the repos to version OpenVPN 2.4.4 to support mixed mode IPv4/IPv6 VPN’s.
> * Switched from lightdm-gtk-greeter to slick-greeter, to provide a much simple and elegant login screen.
 > * Added a desktop right-click “Open Peppermint Settings Panel” context menu item.
 > * Installed mint-translations, so included mint applications are now available with non-English translations.
 > * Fixed peppermint-proxy-configuration on the 32bit ISO.
 > * Improved i3lock lock-screen, similar to the previous one but with a neater looking clock that can be changed between 12hr and 24hr
  > * Advert Blocker reinstated by request, available in the main menu not in the Peppermint Settings Panel.
  > * New *Peppirus* icon theme & Gtk theme.
  > * Changed default wallpaper to Peppermint-3D-Logo-Alternative.
  > * Three additional Ray Bilcliff wallpapers.
  > * Disabled Gtk overlay scrollbars, so the scrollbars don’t overlay other window content making it difficult to see.
  > * Repository now contain tweaked versions of screenfetch and neofetch with custom Peppermint logo ASCII art.
  > * Slightly larger terminal window defaults so neofetch/screenfetch have the room necessary to display properly.
  > * Started adding non-English translated versions of ICE to the repos .. more languages will be added later as we create them (we’re putting in a lot of effort into having full non-English translations for ALL applications hopefully by Peppermint 9).
  > * All other updates from Lubuntu 16.04.x LTS series.
