### Don't bore me, what is different in deepin 15.8?
Well. I'm not going to present some lengthy paragraphs on deepin 15.8. Let's have a quick overview of the features and improvements coming with deepin 15.8.
#### Improved dock experience
In deepin, the dock can have either fashion or efficient layout. With the fashion layout, the dock behaves like a dock. While in the efficient layout, the dock behaves like a taskbar.

In deepin 15.8, the fashion mode includes a hide/show button to manage the tray icons and to save the space. Also, the power button is moved from the tray in order to avoid the confusion and keep it easily accessible.

In the efficient mode, the show desktop button is replaced with a reserved space at the right of the taskbar. This gives a more familiar experience to the users.
#### New page layout for control center
The control center has received a page layout in deepin 15.8. It is adaptive to different resolutions and languages.

#### Reduced ISO size
With all these improvements, what we expect is a bigger installation image. Luckily, it is not true. The deepin 15.8 release is 200 MB smaller than it's predecessor.
