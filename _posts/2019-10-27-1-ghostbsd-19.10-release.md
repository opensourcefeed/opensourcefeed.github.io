As announced earlier, [GhostBSD 19.09 was the last major release in this series](/ghostbsd-19.09-release/). It marked the migration from the TrueOS CURRENT branch to the STABLE branch.

GhostBSD 19.10 is an incremental update on GhostBSD 19.09 and provides a direct update path. If you are already using the 19.09 release, a simple system update will be sufficient for you. GhostBSD 19.10 ISO is released to provide a smoother and easier installation experience to the beginners.

The main highlights in GhostBSD 19.10 are captured below.
> - Enabled UEFI multiboot installation for supported hardware.
- Changed the ISO boot setup
- Removed netmount services
- Corrected the failure handling for the system update.
- Rewrite the code to build the live iso, to fix the issue case by sysroot with EFI.
- Added a folder named ghostbsd in EFI partition and add fallback in \EFI\BOOT
