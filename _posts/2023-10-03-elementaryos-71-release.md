## What's new in elementary OS 7.1?

### Privacy & Consent
One of the standout features of elementary OS 7.1 is its commitment to user privacy. The Background & Autostart Portal, found in System Settings → Applications → Startup, now ensures that apps can't start automatically without your explicit permission. This innovative approach enhances user control over their system.

### Location Services: 
Location services have also been upgraded to use Portals from the old Agents system, providing a more secure method for apps to request access to your location. This not only enhances security but also improves compatibility with cross-platform applications.

### AppCenter & Sideload:
AppCenter, the app store for elementary OS, has received significant attention. It now provides users with detailed information about an app's permissions, ensuring you are informed about what each app can access. Sideload, a feature for installing apps outside of AppCenter, has been improved to allow users to validate their trust in sideloaded apps more easily.
