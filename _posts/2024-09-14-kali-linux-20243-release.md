## What's new in Kali Linux 2024.3?

### Migration to Python 3.12

A key focus of this release is the gradual transition to Python 3.12, which will become the default in Kali Linux 2024.4. This is an important step in ensuring all tools and scripts stay updated with the latest Python version. While some tools might need minor adjustments during this transition, the move will ensure long-term compatibility and performance improvements.

Along with Python 3.12, the update includes **GCC 14** and **glibc 2.40**, ensuring broader support for new software and libraries. These updates will also enhance system stability and performance.

### New Security Tools Added
This version introduces 11 new tools, expanding Kali’s already extensive arsenal. Here are some of the standout tools:
goshs - A SimpleHTTPServer, but written in Go, and with more features
graudit - Grep Rough AUDIT: source code auditing tool
gsocket - Allows two machines on different networks to communicate with each other
hekatomb - Extract and decrypt all credentials from all domain computers 
These new tools enhance Kali’s capability in penetration testing, forensics, and network diagnostics, making it an even more versatile platform for security professionals.

### Kali NetHunter Updates

Nethunter 2024.3 is not avaible now due to the infrastructure update. It will be available in the upcoming weeks. It supports devices running on **Qualcomm Snapdragon SDM845**. This update makes NetHunter more accessible to users with popular mobile hardware, allowing them to conduct on-the-go security assessments.

### Improvements for ARM Devices

Kali Linux 2024.3 includes important updates for ARM builds, particularly enhancing support for **Raspberry Pi** devices. Full support for **Raspberry Pi 5** has been added, making it easier to run Kali on this new hardware. In addition, **Raspberry Pi 4** sees improved performance. These updates make Kali more reliable and faster on low-power devices, which are often used in security testing environments.
