It tracks everything from raw materials to finished products, which helps them use their storage space wisely and avoid wasting anything. Plus, it sends alerts when supplies are low so they can avoid production delays.

ERPNext carries out close integration between procurement and supply chain management, ensuring that vendors, purchase orders, and deliveries are issued on time, as required by production schedules. Automated purchase order tracking helps manufacturers stay on top of supplier performance and avoid disruptions.
