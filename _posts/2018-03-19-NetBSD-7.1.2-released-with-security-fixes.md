### What is NetBSD?
NetBSD is UNIX like operating system developed by the collaborative effort of a large group of people. It also includes a variety of other free software like 4.4BSD Lite2 developed at UC Berkeley.

NetBSD implements several standard APIs and network protocols which makes it interoperable with other systems. One of the founding principles of NetBSD is to be highly portable. Towards this goal, the project has been ported to a wide range of platforms.
