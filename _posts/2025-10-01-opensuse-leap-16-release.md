## What’s new in Leap 16

- **24 months of maintenance & security updates** — users get two years of support at no cost.  
- A **new installer named Agama** replaces the older YaST-based installer for a modern setup experience.  
- **Parallel downloads** in Zypper speed up software installation and updates.  
- The minimal CPU requirement is now **x86-64-v2**, generally meaning CPUs from around 2008 and newer.  
- **32-bit (ia32) support is disabled by default**, but users can re-enable it if needed (for example, to support Steam and its 32-bit libraries).  
- Built from the same source as **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)**, users can migrate between Leap 16 and SLES.  
- The distribution now includes **SELinux** as the default Linux Security Module, while AppArmor remains available as an option.

## Migration and upgrade

If you're on **Leap 15**, there’s a new **openSUSE migration tool** to simplify upgrading to Leap 16.

You can also choose to migrate to **Tumbleweed**, **Slowroll**, or **SLES** based on your preference.

## Lifecycle & future outlook

openSUSE plans to continue **annual minor releases** under Leap 16 until **2031** (up to Leap 16.6). A successor is expected in **2032**.

The immutable server variant, **Leap Micro**, follows the same support schedule.

Leap 16 is a strong foundation for users, developers, and enterprises alike. With longer support, modern tooling, and smoother upgrade paths, it’s well-poised for the coming years.
