GNOME 3.34 is another example that showcases the strength of the open-source community. This release is made possible by thousands of contributions from 777 developers across the world.

## Why it is called *Thessaloniki*?
For the English speakers and readers, the name *Thessaloniki* will look a little strange. It is the name a Greece city where the most recent GUADEC was held on August 2019.

## So, what is new on GNOME 3.34?
There are multiple visible improvements in GNOME 3.34. Following section briefs main highlights.

### Custom icon folder in GNOME application overview
GNOME 3.34 introduces the ability to create custom icon folders in the application overview. This is similar to what we have seen in some mobile devices.

You can drag one icon over another to create a folder combining both. If you remove all the icons from a folder, the folder will be automatically deleted.

This cool feature makes application management easier in the GNOME desktop.

### Improved browsing with GNOME Web
The GNOME Web browser is now able to isolate each web application. This helps to restrict the web application's access to different resources. Also, the web browser introduces the capability to pin favorite tabs.
