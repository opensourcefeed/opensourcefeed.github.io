**Many** companies migrating from on-prem to the cloud often struggle with compatibility issues and unexpected latency that, without proper planning, disrupt operations and hinder the realization of cloud benefits.

The good news is that with careful planning and the right strategies, organizations can address technical challenges while eliminating the need for expensive on-prem hardware maintenance.

**Let's break down three tough challenges of moving desktop workloads to the cloud, so you have a clear roadmap of what to expect and how to address each issue effectively.**

## 1. Security Misconfigurations

Data loss disrupts customer service, delays recovery, and damages reputation, effectively throwing a wrench in business operations. Moving the workload from your on-prem system to the cloud provides opportunities for improved data security and disaster recovery, making the migration process more reliable and efficient.

Unlike physical machines, cloud servers have no direct ties to hardware, which means your data remains safe from hardware failure, natural disasters, or even accidental data loss due to device corruption.

However, this architectural shift creates serious security vulnerabilities. Missteps typically occur during Identity and Access Management (IAM) setup, with overly permissive roles, unencrypted data in transit, or publicly exposed storage buckets.

### The Solution

You need a proactive approach rather than a reactive one to mitigate security misconfiguration issues. Consider simplifying your migration with AI-powered cloud storage solutions that incorporate comprehensive security frameworks.

An [intelligent cloud data storage solution](https://box.com/) helps make the migration frictionless by giving you full control over how data moves and how access is managed. Select a cloud-based system that allows you to organize datasets so they're manageable for both you and your team.

With an intelligent cloud system, you move your desktop works in two ways:

- **Transferring files and folders from the source to the target location without carrying over permission structures.** This process works best when you need a clean start or want to restructure access controls.
- **Migrating all your data while preserving existing permission structures.** This approach works well for organizations that want to maintain the same access and control over content as they did before the move.

After migration, use analytics features to scan your source tools, assess content size, and re-map file ownership. Intelligent cloud platforms also offer a centralized dashboard to manage version histories and monitor access — all without digging through layers of complexity.

## 2. Network Latency

Cloud systems rely on internet-based transfers, so data has to travel through multiple servers. This latency can slow down file access, sync times, and app performance. Without a plan to reduce latency, cloud migration can feel more like a step back than forward.

### The Solution

Implementing a multi-pronged approach to combat latency issues involves:

- Enabling Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for static assets and caching frequently accessed data.
- Refactoring desktop applications to cut down on chatty API calls — too many back-and-forth requests add unnecessary delays.
- Using connection pooling to reuse established network connections rather than opening new ones each time.

For workloads sensitive to latency, consider a hybrid architecture. Keep certain components on-premises while shifting scalable processes to the cloud. To push performance further, implement WAN optimization and TCP acceleration protocols. The right setup keeps your workloads fast, responsive, and cloud-ready.

## 3. Application Compatibility

Many desktop applications depend on Windows-specific dependencies, COM objects, or registry entries that don't exist in cloud environments. These applications were developed with assumptions about file system access, direct hardware interfaces, and locally installed drivers.

When migrating to containerized cloud environments, these dependencies break in unexpected ways. According to a [Box-sponsored IDC white paper](https://www.box.com/resources/idc-reduce-complexity-cbc-services), 30% of organizations cite legacy systems that lack integration capabilities as one of the top barriers to employee productivity and experience. These applications often lack documentation explaining dependencies, making troubleshooting extremely challenging without original developers.

### The Solution

Start with comprehensive application dependency mapping before migration begins. Use appropriate tools to identify registry dependencies, inter-process communications, and hardware requirements that might conflict with cloud architecture.

Consider application modernization approaches like code refactoring or implementing compatibility wrappers rather than forcing legacy applications into containers.

For mission-critical applications that resist containerization, explore desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) solutions that preserve Windows environments while gaining cloud scalability.

## Build a Cloud-Ready Future

Moving from desktop to cloud is a whole different ball game that reshapes how your organization operates. You'll hit roadblocks with security, latency will drive your users crazy, and those legacy apps will fight you every step of the way. But don't sweat it. With solid planning, the right tools, and honest expectations about the process, you can effectively remove the roadblocks.
