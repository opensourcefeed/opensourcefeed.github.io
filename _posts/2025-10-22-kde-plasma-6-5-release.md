## Key Features in KDE Plasma 6.5.0

### Automatic Theme Switching

Plasma 6.5.0 introduces automatic switching between light and dark themes based on the time of day. Users can configure which global themes to use and set wallpapers to adjust accordingly.

### Rounded Window Corners

The Breeze theme now features rounded bottom window corners. This design change can be reverted through system settings if preferred.

### Pinned Clipboard Items

Users can now pin frequently used clipboard items, ensuring quick access to commonly copied text.

### Caret Text Navigation

Caret navigation has been improved, allowing users to zoom directly to the text cursor's location, enhancing text editing efficiency.

### KRunner Fuzzy Search

KRunner's search capabilities have been upgraded with fuzzy matching, enabling users to find applications and files even with minor typos.

## Usability Enhancements

- **Networking Improvements**: The Wi-Fi & Networking page in System Settings has been updated to display detected networks, allowing for direct connections. Additionally, when sharing a network's QR code, the password is now included, simplifying the connection process for others.

- **Remote Desktop Enhancements**: The built-in RDP server now supports clipboard sharing and utilizes existing user accounts, eliminating the need for separate credentials and streamlining remote sessions.

- **Printer Status Notifications**: Users are now notified when their printer is low on ink or toner, preventing unexpected interruptions during printing tasks.

- **Hibernate from Login Screen**: For added convenience, users can now hibernate their system directly from the login screen, providing a quick and efficient way to save session states.

## Visual and Performance Refinements

Plasma 6.5 continues to refine its visual aesthetics and performance:

- **System Tray Enhancements**: The notification system has been improved to provide clearer messages, such as indicating when the system is searching for networks or when a network has been disabled.

- **Audio Settings Updates**: Users are now warned if the "Raise maximum volume" setting is kept active for prolonged periods, which could potentially damage device speakers. Additionally, adjusting the volume while the system is muted now automatically unmutes all playback devices.

- **Tablet Configuration Improvements**: Artists using drawing tablets will appreciate the new configuration options for rotary dials and touch rings, accessible through the System Settings' Drawing Tablet page.

## Under-the-Hood Improvements

Plasma 6.5 also brings several technical enhancements:

- **Updated Dependencies**: The Qt version requirement has been updated to 6.9.0, and the Frameworks version requirement has been updated to 6.18.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest technologies.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Various components have been optimized for better performance, including improvements to the KWayland integration and the addition of QML linting for cleaner code.
