## Improved system installer
The elementary installer has received multiple improvements after the Beta 1 release. This includes more consistency between the views, smoother animation for installation progress, disk detection, and error handling in case of installation failures.

## Flatpak is the future
The elementary team is continuing their effort to make flatpak applications first class. elementary OS 6 now comes with Calculator, Camera, Document Viewer, Screenshot, Tasks, and Web from the AppCenter Flatpak repository. From the user's perspective, they won't experience any difference. Apps launch and behave just as beforeâ€”they just happen to be packaged in a different way under the hood. The team is also planning to migrate more applications from Debian repositories and put them in flatpak repositories.

The elementary team is also working on the AppCenter process for building 3rd party applications.

## Online Accounts
Another noteworthy feature in Beta 2 is support for adding Online Accounts from System Settings. It supports adding both mail and calendar accounts that support the IMAP and CalDav standards. Once added, data from these accounts will show up across the system in apps like Mail, Calendar, and Tasks as well as in the Date & Time panel indicator.

This feature is still under active development.

## Notifications
elementary OS 6 is coming with an improved Notifications system. It provides APIs to add icon badges and action buttons.

## Others
Other changes in elementary OS 6.0 Beta 2 reelase includes improved focus styles, border radius related bug fixes and updated documenation.
