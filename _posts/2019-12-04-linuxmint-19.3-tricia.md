*Linux Mint 19.3 will feature Xfce 4.14*

Linux Mint 19.3 *Tricia* is the 4th stable update in Linux Mint 19.x series. Like other releases in this series, it will be based on Ubuntu 18.04.x foundation. In addition to the packages from Ubuntu repositories, Linux Mint will provide some of the updated packages directly from the upstream projects. This includes Xfce 4.14 and Linux Kernel 5.0.

## What would change in Linux Mint 19.3 <em>Tricia</em>
Linux Mint 19.3 would be based on Ubuntu 18.04.x foundation. So, most of the core packages that built-up the OS will not see any major updates. Even though, <em>Tricia</em> will include some major package updates.

The main changes that we can observe in Linux Mint 19.3 are briefed below.
### System Reports
Linux Mint 19.3 introduces a new tool called System Reports. It automatically identifies the *potential problems* in the system, such as availability of updates, missing language pack and multimedia codes, need for root password ..etc and provides easy solutions for fixing these issues.

The System Reports app can be launched by clicking on small warning icon located on taskbar. This icon may be invisible, if there is no such *issues*.

### Redesigned Logo
The Linux Mint team was working on redesigning the logo for the last few months. The final work is available in Linux Mint *Tricia* release. The updated logo will be reflected in both the Plymouth theme and the Grub screen.

### Celluloid replaces VLC & XPlayer
In <em>Tricia</em> VLC and XPlayer are replaced with Celluloid. More precisely, Celluloid 0.7.

Celluloid is a modern and efficient media player with the roots of MPV. With the usage of GPU, celluloid player offers better performance comparing to VLC and XPlayer. It can handle much larger resolution than XPlayer can handle on the same system.

### Gnote to replace Tomboy
The Tomboy - note-taking application - is replaced with Gnote. Gnote provides the same functionality as Tomboy. The difference is,  Gnote is written using modern libraries and it provides better HiDPI support.

### Xfce 4.14
The Linux Mint 19.3 Xfce Edition features Xfce 4.14. It is a major release of Xfce in 4 years. The Xfce 4.14 is rewritten with Gtk 3.x framework and provides better support for HiDPI scaling.

### Updated Hardware Stack
Linux Mint 19.3 ships kernel 5.0 and Xorg 1.20 to enable better compatibility with modern hardware.
