## üïäÔ∏è Dedicated to Lunar  
Tails 7.0 is dedicated to the memory of **Lunar (1982‚Äì2024)** ‚Äì a long-time Tor volunteer, Free Software hacker, and community organizer. Lunar‚Äôs contributions to Tails, Tor, Debian, and the Reproducible Builds project helped shape the privacy and security landscape we know today.

## ‚ö° Faster Startup  
Tails 7.0 boots **10‚Äì15 seconds faster** on most computers by switching the image compression algorithm from xz to **zstd**.  
* The images are ~10% larger than before.  
* On low-quality USB sticks, startup might still be slower.  
* The Tails team recommends buying USB sticks from reliable sources to avoid counterfeit electronics.
