**Solus 4.0** is a stable snapshot of Solus, released on 17th March 2019. This snapshot was released with GNOME 3.28. As a rolling distribution, Solus delivered GNOME 30, 32 and 34 as contineous updates.

In this blog post, I would like to share screenshots of Solus GNOME Edition with all updates as of 18th January 2019. It features GNOME 3.34.3, LibreOffice 6.3.x and other updates.

It took more than 1 GB to update the system after a fresh installation. This is almost comparable with the size of installation. <em>It is very high time for Solus to provide an updated installation media for new users</em>. Because, need for a long update after installing a fresh system don't provide a good impression for the users.
