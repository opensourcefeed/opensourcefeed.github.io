**The** feren OS team has kick started their activities in 2018 by launching an updated snapshot. This snapshot brings various updated packages, bug fixes and enhancements over the previous release. 

The feren OS 2018.1 (Let me call it in that way) provides a smooth update path from previous release via update manager. A clear update path between releases is one among the objectives of ferenOS!.
