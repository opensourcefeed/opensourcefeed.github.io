**The** National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides financial support for people with disability to help them access services and support to improve their lives and reach their goals. There are many funding streams under NDIS and in this blog, we will discuss one of the categories of NDIS funding called Capital Supports.

Capital Supports, which cover higher-cost products, home modifications, and assistance that promote accessibility, mobility, and independent living, is one of the crucial components of this financing.

In contrast to other NDIS funding streams, Capital Supports prioritise long-term investments such as home adaptations, assistive technology, and specialised disability accommodations. For people using [Disability Services in NSW](https://livingmyway.org.au/), these services are helpful because they provide the resources and tools to help improve their quality of life.

Understanding how Capital Supports work can help in navigating the NDIS. Let’s go over the key details, eligibility, and how people can use this funding to enhance their daily lives.

## What are Capital Supports?

Capital Supports are one of the three main funding categories in the NDIS. It is designed for funding physical items or long-term investments that help support people with disabilities participate more fully in daily activities. Unlike Core Supports, which focus on everyday needs, or Capacity Building Supports, which help develop skills, Capital Supports are for items that provide structural or equipment-based assistance.

There are two key components under this category: 

- **Assistive Technology (AT)** – Devices and equipment that help with mobility, communication, and personal care.  
- **Home Modifications and Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)** – Changes to a home or specialised housing for people with significant support needs.

Many disability support services in Australia help participants choose the type of assistance they require and make sure their NDIS plan reflects their individual needs.

## Assistive Technology (AT): What It Covers and Who Can Access It

The term "assistive technology" (AT) describes devices that help people with disabilities perform their daily tasks. This might include items such as shower chairs or more sophisticated equipment such as motorised wheelchairs or speech-generating gadgets. 

To qualify for AT funding under the NDIS, a person's plan must include an assessed need for the technology. The level of funding depends on the type of AT required:

- **Low-cost** – Items that can be purchased without an assessment, such as walking sticks. Note: While some low-cost items may not require a formal assessment, it's important to check with the NDIS or a Support Coordinator.
- **Mid-cost** – Equipment that may require a quote or additional support documentation, such as customised wheelchairs.
- **High-cost** – Complex, specialised equipment that requires detailed assessment and approval, such as prosthetic limbs or high-tech communication devices.

Participants often work with a Support Coordinator to navigate the funding and help ensure they receive the necessary AT suited to their needs.

## Home Modifications and Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)

Housing that isn't designed with accessibility in mind might be a significant obstacle to independence for some people with disabilities. [Disability services in Sydney](https://livingmyway.org.au/services/support-workers/) can play a key role in helping participants with home modifications and supporting them to have improved access to comfortable living spaces.

### Home Modifications

Home modifications are structural changes that improve accessibility. These modifications can include the following:

- Installing ramps for wheelchair access  
- Widening doorways to accommodate mobility aids  
- Adding grab rails in bathrooms  
- Lowering kitchen benches for ease of use

When an assessment concludes that a change is necessary for an individual's safety and independence, the NDIS may provide the funding. An occupational therapist (OT) usually evaluates the house and suggests any required modifications as part of the procedure. Numerous NDIS Registered Providers have knowledge in these modifications and can provide support to help ensure the work complies with NDIS regulations.

### Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)

SDA funding is for people who require specialist housing solutions due to functional impairment or high support needs. This funding does not cover rent, but rather the cost of designing and building accessible housing.

SDA properties are designed with accessibility features such as:

- Ceiling hoists for people with limited mobility  
- Reinforced walls for support structures  
- Smart home technology for independent control of lighting and appliances  
- Emergency communication systems

For people who require SDA, professionals offering [Support Coordination in Sydney](https://livingmyway.org.au/services/support-coordination/) can help facilitate the process, ensuring that the right supports are in place.

## How to Access Capital Supports Provided by an NDIS Plan

Accessing Capital Supports requires a well-documented plan that outlines the need for specific equipment or modifications. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Assessment** – The person’s needs are assessed by a qualified specialist (such as an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, or speech pathologist). However, depending on the kind of service being sought, the evaluation procedure may change.
2. **NDIS Plan Development** – The NDIS participant works with a planner or Local Area Coordinator (LAC) to include Capital Supports in their plan.
3. **Approval and Funding Allocation** – The NDIS reviews the request and determines the funding amount.
4. **Purchasing Equipment or Making Modifications** – Once approved, participants can purchase the approved assistive technology or proceed with home modifications through NDIS Registered Providers. It's important to note that for some AT, a trial period might be required before final purchase.

For those unfamiliar with the process, an experienced Support Coordinator NDIS can help streamline the application and support the completion of necessary documentation.

## Key Considerations and Common Questions

### Does NDIS Cover All Costs?

Capital Supports funding is usually provided based on reasonable and necessary criteria. In some cases, the person may need to contribute additional funds if the chosen product or modification exceeds the approved budget.

### What If an Item Needs Repairs or Replacement?

The NDIS may fund repairs and replacements for assistive technology, particularly for mid- and high-cost items. Low-cost items are less likely to have ongoing funding for repairs or replacements, and these costs may need to be covered by the participant. Disability services in NSW can help people understand what is covered under their funding.

### Can Funding Be Used for Any Equipment?

No, only equipment and modifications that are considered reasonable and necessary for the person’s disability needs will be funded. Recreational or luxury items typically do not qualify, unless they serve a functional purpose. Consulting a Support Coordinator can help determine what qualifies under the scheme.

## Why Do Capital Supports Matter?

Funding from Capital Supports can help remove obstacles and provide people with disabilities the same opportunities as others. Whether it's a power wheelchair that facilitates movement, a kitchen that has been modified to allow for autonomous cooking, or a specially designed house that offers accessibility, these aids can have a positive impact on people's lives.

To access these options, people with disabilities might need some assistance. With the right support services, participants can experience greater independence and inclusion in their communities.

## Final Thoughts

Although navigating NDIS Capital Supports might seem complicated, it can go more smoothly if you understand what funding is available and how to best access it.

If you or someone you know needs guidance on Capital Supports, speaking with a Support Coordinator can help clarify the best options. Services providing support coordination in Sydney can assist people in managing funding, organising assessments, and liaising with NDIS registered providers to help ensure participants receive the support they need.
