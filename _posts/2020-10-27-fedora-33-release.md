## What's new in Fedora 33?
### Brtfs to be the default file system
The major highlight in Fedora 33 is the replacement ext file system with the Brtfs. Fedora has been using extfs since Fedora Core 1. Now, the time has come to shift the line. Fedora 33 will be using Brtfs as the default file system in all variations, including desktop and server editions.

Fedora 33 will be offering basic features of Brtfs, while the upcoming releases will bring more goodness from Brtfs culture.

### Fedora 33 Worksation
Fedora 33 Workstation will be featuring GNOME 3.38, the latest release of GNOME announced two weeks back. GNOME 3.38 brings a lot of performance improvements and user experience improvements. The highlights in GNOME 3.38 include a brand new Welcome Screen, multimonitor screen recording, and even the ability to rearrange icons in the app launcher.

### Other highlights
- With Fedora 33 release, Fedora IoT becomes an official Edition of Fedora. 
- Nano will be the default editor when using the terminal. Still, users can configure other editors like emacs and vim.
- Fedora KDE spin introduces earlyOOM by default. This helps to clean the memory when there is a shortage and to make the system more responsive.
- and other usual package updates.
