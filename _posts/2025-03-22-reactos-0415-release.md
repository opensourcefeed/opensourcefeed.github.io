## Key Highlights of ReactOS 0.4.15:

> - **Enhanced Plug and Play Support::** Major rewrites to the Plug and Play Manager now allow ReactOS to support a broader range of third-party drivers and enable booting from USB devices. This advancement enhances compatibility with various hardware configurations.
- **Improved Audio Functionality::** The new version adds support for additional audio formats, looped playback of wave files, higher sample rates, and multiple output channels. Integration of the open-source AC'97 driver from the Windows Driver Kit ensures out-of-the-box sound support in VirtualBox and on motherboards from 2004 and earlier.
- **Memory Management and Cache Controller Updates::** Refactoring of Section Objects has resolved long-standing issues, allowing executables to run from remote locations like network shares. The incorporation of the Microsoft FAT filesystem driver from the Windows Driver Kit improves performance and stability, enabling proper ejection of external drives with FAT filesystems.
- **Registry Enhancements::** New mechanisms for registry healing, flushing, and caching have been implemented to bolster system stability and performance, especially during unexpected power outages or system crashes.
- **Accessory and System Tool Improvements::** Updates to Notepad, Paint, the ReactOS Application Manager (RAPPS), the Input Method Editor, and various shell enhancements contribute to a more polished user experience.
- This release is dedicated to Eric Kohl, celebrating his first commit to the ReactOS codebase in 1999. His unwavering dedication and contributions have been instrumental in the project's growth and success.

ReactOS 0.4.15 represents a significant milestone, with nearly eight times more commits than the previous release, 0.4.14. This substantial progress reflects the collective efforts of numerous contributors and sets the stage for continued development and innovation.
