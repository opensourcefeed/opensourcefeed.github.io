**Mr.** *Leszek* of the Neptune project has announced the release of Neptune 5.4. It is the latest updated snapshot in Neptune 5.x series. It brings a set of updated packages and applications and avoids the need for the bulk package update after installing the operating system.

In addition to package updates and critical bug fixes, Neptune 5.4 brings a fresh look and feel with an improved dark theme.  This dark theme also includes a modified version of *Faenza* icon theme. Neptune 5.4 also brings Linux Kernel 5.16.x. It ensures better hardware support.
