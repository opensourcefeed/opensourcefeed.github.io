![App testing in 2025 feature image](/assets/images/post-images/guest-posts/app-testing/1.jpg)

Why would you choose app testing services in 2025? A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that software bugs cost the US economy $59.5 billion annually, with more than a third of this cost avoidable through improved testing practices. What is more, the average global cost of a data breach is estimated at $3.86 million, which only emphasizes the critical role of thorough testing in protecting us all against security vulnerabilities.

Doesn’t that say a lot about the importance of vigorous testing for your mobile or web app?

But what are app testing services to start with? They provide [professional services](https://mwdn.com/index.html) to verify that your application, whether it's mobile, web, or platform-specific, works as intended, is user-friendly, performs well under load, and is free of critical bugs.

## Types of testing services: Mobile, web, OS-specific

The approach to testing you take depends on the type of application you're building: a mobile app, a web app, or something platform-specific like Android or iOS. Here's how they differ.

### Web app testing services

Web app testing makes sure that your application works perfectly across different browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge, and on various devices, including desktops and mobile devices.

This kind of testing checks for cross-browser compatibility, layout responsiveness, performance, broken links, form functionality, and security vulnerabilities. The focus here is on how the application behaves within the browser, rather than on the operating system or hardware. What does web app testing include?

- **Cross-browser testing** – Ensures compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.  
- **Responsiveness testing** – Validates how the app adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Functional testing** – Confirms all buttons, forms, and workflows work properly.  
- **Load and stress testing** – Simulates high traffic to test scalability.  
- **Accessibility testing** – Ensures compliance with WCAG standards for users with disabilities.  
- **Security testing** – Protects against threats like XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks.

A broken web app leads to lost users, sales, and credibility. Testing ensures reliability and professional quality.

### Mobile app testing services

Mobile app testing focuses on applications designed specifically for smartphones and tablets. These could be native apps built for one platform, hybrid apps that work on multiple, or mobile versions of web apps.

Key components of mobile testing:

- **Functional testing** – Verifies all features work as expected.  
- **Compatibility testing** – Ensures the app runs on various devices, OS versions, and screen resolutions.  
- **Performance testing** – Checks speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.  
- **Usability testing** – Evaluates user experience and interface intuitiveness.  
- **Security testing** – Protects against vulnerabilities like data leaks or unauthorized access.  
- **Installation and update testing** – Validates smooth install, uninstall, and updates.

### OS-specific testing

#### Android app testing  
Deals with the challenge of Android fragmentation—hundreds of devices and versions. Also ensures compliance with Google Play policies and Android-specific APIs.

#### iOS app testing  
Focuses on Apple’s design/privacy guidelines, frequent OS updates, and App Store review policies. Also tests for iCloud, Face ID, Apple Pay, and more.
