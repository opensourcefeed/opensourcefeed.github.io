## What's new in Kali Linux 2021.3
The noteworthy improvements in Kali Linux 2021.3 are as follows:

> - The OpenSSL in Kali 2021.3 enables communication with systems using older protocols such as TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 and other legacy ciphers. This will help Kali users to target a wide range of machines. And give the opportunity to attack machines having older protocols and algorithms. This option can be changed from Kali Tweaks.
- With the release of Kali 2021.3, the Kali Linux team is introducing a fresh documentation suite. The Kali Tools will enable the users to have access to documentation in a more organized manner. It can be modified by the users. Once the documentation is mature enough, it will be available in Kali releases for offline access.
- Kali Linux is now more optimized to work on Virtual Machines. It allows easy copy and pastes between guest and host machines. Also, from Kali Tweaks, users can now enable [Hyper-V session enhanced mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/use-local-resources-on-hyper-v-virtual-machine-with-vmconnect)
- Introducing new tools such as 
  - Berate_ap - Orchestrating MANA rogue Wi-Fi Access Points
  - CALDERA - Scalable automated adversary emulation platform
  - EAPHammer - Targeted evil twin attacks against WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi networks
  - HostHunter - Recon tool for discovering hostnames using OSINT techniques
  - RouterKeygenPC - Generate default WPA/WEP Wi-Fi keys
  - Subjack - Subdomain takeover
  - WPA_Sycophant - Evil client portion of EAP relay attack
- Introducing the worldâ€™s first Kali NetHunter smartwatch, the TicHunter Pro. This is still in the experimental phase, and only USB attacks are available.
- Kali NetHunter to Android 11 devices without a fully working TWRP!
- Each Kali NetHunter image can be flashed as a Magisk module. This work is still in its infancy and more work is needed to bring it up to par with the traditional installer through TWRP.
- Improvements on desktop themes
