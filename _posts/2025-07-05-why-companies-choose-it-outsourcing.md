## 4 cases for choosing IT outsourcing model

Different companies turn to IT outsourcing for different reasons, but the goal is usually the same: to grow efficiently without losing focus. Whether you're looking to save costs, scale faster, or tap into global expertise, outsourcing can offer exactly what you need – when you need it.

### Case 1: Lower costs without cutting corners

IT outsourcing allows companies to cut costs significantly without giving up on quality. Expanding internal teams comes with costs of hiring, onboarding, equipment, and benefits. As an alternative, your company can use outside providers like [Scalosoft](https://www.scalosoft.com/).

So, the good thing about IT outsourcing is that you only pay your partner for the work they actually do. This model helps you keep your budget under control and reduces the risk of overspending. Outsourcing also saves you time because when you bring in an outside team, you get access to ready-made tools, environments, and processes without implementing them yourself.

### Case 2: Access to huge pool of IT talents

There is a shortage of specialists in the global IT market. Millions of vacancies remain unfilled, especially for experienced engineers. Outsourcing provides access to a wide pool of experts from around the world without geographical barriers.

Now, you don't have to choose between a compromise candidate and months of searching. Instead, you can hire a team with the skills your project needs, from DevOps to UX designers to AI specialists.

Plus, experienced outsourcing partners often work with companies in industries similar to yours. This gives them a better understanding of the sector's specifics and challenges, allowing them to select the best people for the job.

---

### Case 3: Faster delivery and smarter growth

Instead of building a team from scratch, you can start working with a ready-made, close-knit team operating on tested processes and agile methodologies. This allows new products or features to reach the market faster without overstretching your internal team.

IT outsourcing also enables parallel work on different components of the project (e.g., backend, frontend, and testing), which increases efficiency and shortens the final solution's delivery time.

---

### Case 4: Strategic focus for internal teams

External IT support is not a threat to internal structures but rather its reinforcement. Thanks to outsourcing, the core team can focus on tasks critical to business development. Operational or repetitive activities can be transferred to an external partner, which relieves the team and improves its efficiency. In addition, outsourcing allows you to respond quickly to changing needs without the need for lengthy recruitment or team reorganization.
