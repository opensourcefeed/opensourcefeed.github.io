### What does rebasing mean for KDE neon?
KDE neon is a distribution built to deliver the latest technologies from KDE family as soon as it is available. The images are built on top of Ubuntu LTS base and provide a strong platform to rely on. KDE neon is a part of KDE community itself instead of standing as a separate project. It provides the project an opportunity to work closely with KDE technologies.

The migration to Ubuntu 18.04 *Bionic Beaver* implies a set of updated packages, drivers and better hardware compatibility to KDE neon users. This will help the users to focus on their work instead of worrying about the outdated operating system. With rebasement, the KDE neon can focus more their *snap* integration to provide a smooth installation for application from KDE family and other communities.

KDE neon provides a migration plan from Ubuntu 16.04 based installations. This migration path was thoroughly tested in the last few months, and most of the issues have been fixed.
