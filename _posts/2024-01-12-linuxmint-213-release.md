## What's new in Linux Mint 21.3 Virginia?

### Compatibility Boost and ISO Improvements
Linux Mint 21.3 is all about compatibility. It plays nice with SecureBoot and a wider range of systems thanks to Grub in EFI mode and Isolinux/syslinux in BIOS mode. Behind the scenes, the tools for making Mint's ISO images got a refresh minimizing differences between LMDE and Linux Mint images.

### Hypnotix TV Viewer: More Fun Watching TV

Hypnotix, the TV viewer, got a makeover too. You can now mark channels as favorites for quick access. The new version lets you create your own custom channels from any streamable URL, meaning no more hassle with playlists or IPTV providers.

### Cinnamon 6.0: Actions, Wayland, and More

Cinnamon 6.0 brings "Actions," a new kind of add-on to spruce up your file manager's context menu. Plus, there's experimental Wayland support for those wanting a taste of the future. Other goodies include the return of 75% scaling, configurable settings, and new gestures.

### More Goodies and Visual Upgrades

Warpinator now lets you connect manually, Sticky notes get even handier with DBUS commands, and Slick Greeter allows you to align the login box as you like. Bulky, the file renaming tool, now supports thumbnails, and Pix, the image viewer, is smarter with video orientation.

### Aesthetic Touch: Backgrounds and More

Linux Mint 21.3 comes with a fresh set of backgrounds from talented artists. The visual elements are top-notch, thanks to contributions from Aurel Manea, Constantin, and others.

### Technical Side: Kernel and Support Strategy

Under the hood, Linux Mint 21.3 packs Linux kernel 5.15 and uses an Ubuntu 22.04 package base. It's committed to security updates until 2027. Plus, upgrades will be a breeze until 2024, as Mint sticks with the same package base.
