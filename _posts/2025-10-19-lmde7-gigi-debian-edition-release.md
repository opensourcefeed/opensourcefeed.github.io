**The** Linux Mint team has released **LMDE 7 “Gigi”**, the latest version of the Debian-based Mint edition. LMDE — short for *Linux Mint Debian Edition* — aims to deliver the same Mint desktop experience while relying on Debian instead of Ubuntu as its base.

## What is LMDE

LMDE provides a near-identical user experience to Linux Mint but built directly on Debian. This design ensures Mint can continue independently if Ubuntu changes its direction in the future. It also offers a more direct Debian package ecosystem while retaining Mint’s familiar look and feel.

## What’s new in LMDE 7 “Gigi”

> - Based on **Debian 13 “Trixie”**  
- Ships with **Linux kernel 6.12**  
- Inherits UI and tool improvements from recent Linux Mint 22.2 releases  
- Adds **OEM installation support** for hardware vendors  
- Drops support for **32-bit systems**; 64-bit only  
- Improved fingerprint login and hardware compatibility  

## Why it matters

LMDE 7 ensures Linux Mint’s continuity beyond Ubuntu. It combines Debian’s reliability with Mint’s usability and polish. The updated kernel offers broader hardware support, and the new features make it suitable for both fresh installations and upgrades.

## Who should try it

- **Current LMDE users** can upgrade from LMDE 6 using the Mint upgrade tool.  
- **Mint users** seeking a Debian-based variant can install LMDE 7 for the same look and workflow.  
- **New users** with modern 64-bit systems will find it stable, lightweight, and ready for daily use.
