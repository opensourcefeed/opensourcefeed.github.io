**On** 20th March 2020, the Linux Mint team has announced the release of LMDE 4.0 with code name *Debbie*. LMDE (abbreviation for Linux Mint Debian Edition) is an experimental project to ensure the Linux Mint project can continue even if Ubuntu disappears one day. This project also ensures the packages and user experience of Linux Mint distributions can exist outside the Ubuntu eco-system also.

LMDE 4.0 *Debbie* is based on the Debian 10.x *Buster* branch. In addition to all packages from *Buster*, LMDE 4.0 uses some backport repositories to provide a set of latest packages and tools. The main highlights in LMDE 4.0 are briefed below.

> - Automated partitioning with support for LVM and full-disk encryption
- Home directory encryption
- Support for automated installation of NVIDIA drivers
- NVMe support
- SecureBoot support
- Btrfs subvolumes support
- Revamped installer
- Automatic installation of microcode packages
- Automatic resolution bump for the live session to a minimum of 1024×768 in Virtualbox.
- Linux Mint 19.3 improvements (HDT, Boot-repair, System reports, language settings, HiDPI and artwork improvements, new boot menus, Celluloid, Gnote, Drawing, Cinnamon 4.4, XApp status icons…etc)
