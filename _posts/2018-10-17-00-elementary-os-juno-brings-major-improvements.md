##### AppCenter
The elementary AppCenter is a unique idea for creating a sustainable App Ecosystem. It invites the developers to publishers their Apps and provides them to chance to monetize their Apps. This helps to keep a sustainable-app-eco-system. 

AppCenter in *Juno* provides various options to pay for the App. Either user can pay for App on the purchase, or can fund the development. All these happen without compromising the idea of open source.
