Using the updated theme tweaks, gradients are color neutral now. This means the blue gradient of Feren OS Gtk is one color, with different transparencies to give off the effect of a lighter gradient. The themes made using theme colorizer will always have some gradient buttons despite the configuration chosen.

Inheriting the code from the Breeze GTK 3 and GTK 2 themes, the scrollbars in the Feren GTK Themes are now designed to look like the ones we'll find on KDE's default theme
