## Introduction

ID scanners have become an important part of today's tech, playing a significant role in enhancing security and compliance across various industries. These devices are designed to read and verify the information on identification documents, such as driver's licenses or ID cards, making sure the person is who they say they are. The use of ID scanners is particularly important in scenarios where age verification is necessary, such as in bars, retail settings, and other venues where age-restricted products or services are offered.

The concept of identity verification has a long history, as shown [in this infographic](https://medium.com/@trulioo/infographic-the-history-of-id-verification-4c2144cce0c3) about ID verification history, which spans over 100,000 years. This historical context highlights the ongoing need for reliable methods to confirm identities and highlights how modern ID scanners meet this need.

## The Role of ID Scanners in Security

- **Access Control:** ID scanners are used in secure facilities to control entry, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access certain areas.
- **Fraud Prevention:** By verifying the authenticity of IDs, scanners help prevent identity theft and fraudulent activities.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Businesses in industries like hospitality, retail, and transportation use ID scanners to comply with legal requirements for age and identity verification.

In addition to these applications, ID scanners offer benefits such as:

- **Efficiency:** They provide quick and accurate verification, reducing wait times and improving customer experience.
- **Data Accuracy:** Scanners reduce human error by automatically capturing and recording ID information.

Overall, the adoption of ID scanners is a proactive way to protect businesses and customers, ensuring that security and compliance are upheld in a seamless and efficient manner.
