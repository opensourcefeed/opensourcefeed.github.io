## What's new in Fedora 34 BETA?
> - Fedora 34 BETA Workstation and the upcoming stable release features GNOME 40, a redesigned - and mostly rewritten release of GNOME. GNOME 40 brings a redesigned activities overview and enhancements to other core components. [Read what's new in GNOME 40](https://www.opensourcefeed.org/gnome-40-release/).
- Fedora 34 BETA will see a transition from PulseAudio to PipeWire for mixing and managing audio steams. The PipeWire will support low-latency for professional use cases, and thus will be a single option for both desktop users and professional users. Also, it is better designed to meet the needs of containers and flatpak applications.
- After introducing Brtfs as the default file system in Fedora 33, Fedora 34 BETA implements transparent compression to optimize disk usage. This compression will improve read/write time for larger files, and thus increases the time efficiency.
- Fedora Linux 34 BETA brings better handling for out-of-memory (OOM) situations by enabling systemd-oomd by default.
