**Serpent OS**, the ambitious independent distribution, is rebranding to *AerynOS*. This change comes after long consideration and a desire to better reflect the project's goals and aspirations.

The Serpent OS team acknowledged that the name "Serpent" carried negative connotations, which wasn't ideal for a project aiming to build trust and community. They felt the old name no longer represented the mature and technically sound operating system they've been developing. This rebranding marks a significant step forward, signifying their commitment to the project's long-term success.

## Why AerynOS?

The new name, pronounced like "Erin," has deeper meaning. It draws from Latin roots ("Aer") and nods to the project's Irish heritage through the phonetic similarity to "Erin." The team believes AerynOS is more inviting and accurately captures the essence of the distribution. They aim to create a user-friendly and technically robust OS, proving that innovation can thrive without corporate constraints.

## What's Changing?

While the name is changing, the core team remains the same, ensuring continuity and a seamless transition for users. The project is moving full steam ahead, with a new website (AerynOS.com), developer platform (AerynOS.dev), and updated social media presence. The transition will culminate on March 17, 2025 (St. Patrick's Day!), when the old Serpent OS branding will be officially retired. The team is diligently migrating all resources, including their GitHub organization, and ensuring that the old repositories are clearly marked as deprecated to avoid confusion.

## A Bright Future for AerynOS

The AerynOS team is excited about this new chapter. They're planning increased transparency and have hinted at exciting news to come. They'll also be actively seeking community involvement in areas like web development, translations, and artwork. With this rebranding, AerynOS is poised to make a significant impact on the independent Linux scene. Keep an eye on AerynOS â€“ it's a distribution to watch!
