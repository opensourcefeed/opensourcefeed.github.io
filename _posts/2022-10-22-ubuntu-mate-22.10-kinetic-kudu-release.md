## What is new in Ubuntu MATE 22.10?

Ubuntu MATE 22.10 has fewer changes compared to the previous releases. This is because the key contributor *Martin Wimpress* was working on Debian MATE to provide a consistent user experience in Debian MATE and Ubuntu MATE. It will help to reduce the integration effort required in the future. The following section briefly explains the key highlights of Ubuntu MATE 22.10 Kinetic Kudu.

MATE Desktop will ship this feature in 1.28.0 only, however, Ubuntu MATE users can use it earlier. The Tweaks application is updated to accommodate the same while switching the layouts.
- Ships beautiful AI-generated Kinetic Kudu wallpapers. According to the author, it was [very challenging to generate natural-looking Kinetic Kudu wallpaper](https://twitter.com/simonjbutcher/status/1572574722612920322).
