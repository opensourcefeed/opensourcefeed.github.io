## What’s New in Siduction 2024.1.0?

This release brings the latest updates from Debian Unstable (Sid), enriched with thoughtful improvements and polished features for an enhanced Linux experience:  

- **KDE Plasma 6.2**: Experience the power and elegance of KDE’s latest desktop environment, set as the default for Debian 13 *“Trixie”*. Although Wayland is the default session type for Plasma 6, Siduction uses X11 by default for compatibility reasons during encrypted installations.  
- **Xfce 4.20**: The newly released Xfce 4.20 focuses on performance and introduces experimental Wayland support. However, Wayland sessions are currently blocked due to known bugs.  
- **LXQt 2.1.0**: Lightweight and efficient, LXQt now includes experimental Wayland support.  
- **Linux Kernel 6.12.4**: Offers cutting-edge hardware support and enhanced performance.  
- **Improved Btrfs Support**: With new SUSE developed Snapper integration, managing snapshots is easier than ever.  

## Known Issues  
- **KDE Plasma**: Dolphin file manager cannot connect via `smb://`. Use `sftp://` as a temporary workaround.  
- **Xfce**: Wayland sessions are currently disabled due to startup issues.  

## New Artwork: "Shine On…"  
The release features beautiful new artwork inspired by Pink Floyd’s *“Shine On You Crazy Diamond”*, with a wallpaper designed by Krystian Zajdel. This design is a tribute to the KDE developers for their tireless contributions.
