## Key Changes in GhostBSD 24.07.1

The GhostBSD 24.07.1 release marks a significant transition from building OS packages from GhostBSD ports to FreeBSD PKGBSD. This shift required extensive testing but promised enhanced performance and stability for users. If you haven't updated to GhostBSD 24.04.2, it's recommended to back up your data and perform a fresh installation of 24.07.1. Due to changes with PKGBSD, users upgrading from versions earlier than 24.04.2 may experience issues.
