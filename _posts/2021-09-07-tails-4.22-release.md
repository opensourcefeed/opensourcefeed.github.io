One of the most relevant highlights of Tails 4.22 is the fix for most of the issues in the Tor Connection assistant. These improvements make it much easier to use the Tor connection assistant.

## What's new in the Tails 4.22 release?

The salient features in the Tails 4.22 release are as follows.
### Package updates

- Tor Browser to 10.5.6.
- Thunderbird to 78.13.
- AMD graphics firmware 20210818 to improve the support for some AMD graphics cards.

### User experience improvements in the Tor Connection Assistant.
- Allow only one bridge to input at a time. Previously, there was a provision to enter multiple bridges, however, only the first one was used.
- Provision to save the custom bridge input.
- Allow setting the time manually if the Tor connection is failing.
- Reduce the timeout that determines whether we can connect to Tor at all from 30 seconds to 10 seconds
- Allow trying again to connect to Tor from the error screen.
