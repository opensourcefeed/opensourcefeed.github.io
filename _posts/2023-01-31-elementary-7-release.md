- Onboarding includes a new view for configuring automatic updates, and adds a *Sunset to Sunrise* option for the dark style.
- The Mail App has undergone a redesign to have a more contemporary, flat look and is being made more responsive. The unified inbox now accommodates Microsoft 365 accounts, and various potential crashes and freezes have been fixed.
- The printer settings received significant improvements with redesigns and added features, such as the ability to clear print queues for each printer and a more straightforward view of ink levels.

- Paid special attention on the performance improvement and has rewritten several parts of the system towards this objective.

### Developer platform improvement

The elementary OS 7 makes the developer experience much better.
- Most app icons have been changed to a uniform tile shape with added elements. The new design is modern and still keeps its charm while allowing for creativity.
- The elementary OS 7 uses Gtk4 more extensively. Some apps and desktop parts have already been changed to Gtk4, such as Calculator, Sideload, Shortcuts, Music, and Onboarding. More changes to Gtk4 will happen during OS 7's lifetime.
- Elementary app framework Granite and system stylesheet updated for Gtk 4 with new features and API changes for easier app building.
- The Code app is optimized for responsiveness and can now be tiled on small displays. Project sidebar is full-height and source view has new light/dark styles. Code follows system-wide dark style preference.
