Kali Linux 2017.3 also includes some new tools which will come handy during security assesments and penetration testing. Tools added in this relese includes:

> * InSpy : A small but useful utility that performs enumeration on LinkedIn and can find people based on job title, company, or email address.
> *  CherryTree - The oft-requested CherryTree has now been added to Kali for all of your note-taking needs. CherryTree is very easy to use and will be familiar to you if you’ve used any of the “big-name” note organization applications.
> * Sublist3r - Sublist3r is a great application that enables you to enumerate subdomains across multiple sources at once. It has integrated the venerable SubBrute, allowing you to also brute force subdomains using a wordlist.
> * OSRFramework - Another excellent OSINT tool that has been added to the repos is OSRFramework, a collection of scripts that can enumerate users, domains, and more across over 200 separate services.
> * Also, Massive Maltego Metamorphosis
