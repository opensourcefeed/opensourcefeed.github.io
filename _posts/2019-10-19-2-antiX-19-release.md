antiX 19 is developed from Debian 10 *Buster* packages. Though it does not contain systemd - (an init system) or it's dependencies.  This means, with antiX 19 you can enjoy all of the benefits of Debian Buster and protect yourself from the [sins of systemd](https://nosystemd.org/).

## antiX 19 flavors
As the usual release practice of antiX, antiX 19 is also coming in 4 different flavors. All these flavors are available for 32 BIT and 64 BIT machines. The 32-bit flavor makes uses a non-PAE kernel. It implies the 32-bit edition can not support RAM more than 4 GB.
