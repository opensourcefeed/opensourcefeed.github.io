Since PCLinuxOS 2019.11 is a rolling snapshot, there is no need to perform a fresh installation if you are already running PCLinuxOS. A simple system update operation will make all the updates available for you. The incremental updates are created to avoid the need for updating thousands of megabytes of packages after installation.

## What's new in PCLinuxOS 2019.11?
In addition to the updated Linux Kernel and Nvidia packages, the Live USB creator is also updated in all flavors of PCLinux OS. It enables creating multiple PCLinuxOS bootable images in the same pen drive. Also, there are some theme updates that affect grub screen, boot animation and desktop.

The KDE Editions (both minimal and Darkstar) include Plasma desktop 5.17.3, Plasma Applications 19.08.3 and Plasma Frameworks 5.64.0.

The MATE applications and libraries have been updated to the most recent versions.
