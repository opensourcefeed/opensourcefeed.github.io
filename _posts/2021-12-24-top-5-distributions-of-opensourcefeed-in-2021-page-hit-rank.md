**In** the OpenSourceFeed Gallery, we have a page that ranks the distributions based on page hit count each month. The page hit count is collected from Google Analytics using a python script.

The page hit rank indicates growing interest around each distribution and how we are doing for that particular distribution from the SEO perspective. It does not imply the overall quality of popularity of the distribution.
