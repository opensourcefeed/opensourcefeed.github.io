In this review, let us explore the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Xfce spin, downloaded on 20th June 2020. This flavor of OpenSUSE offers all the core benefits of OpenSUSE. Also, it comes with a professionally configured look and feels. Let's go through it.

## Specifications
- [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Xfce Live CD](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed)
- HP Probook 4230s - 2011
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2310M CPU @ 2.10GHz
- RAM - 2GiB

## Pros
- OpenSUSE Xfce Spin Includes the core benefits of OpenSUSE like YaST Control Center for system administration, stability, and latest packages as in Tumbleweed repositories.
- OpenSUSE Xfce is having a professional look and feel, with a slightly customized version of Greybird Gtk Theme, Elementary Xfce Icon theme, and wisely chosen fonts with optimum contrast settings. Even though distributions like [Xubuntu](/distribution/xubuntu) have similar theme configurations, the font selection, and contrast settings are not the best in those distributions.
- The live image comes with a minimum, but all essential applications. So, it does not give a bloated feeling.

## Cons
- Memory usage is slightly higher compared to Debian based Xfce distributions like [MX](/distribution/mx), [Xubuntu](/distribution/xubuntu), and [Linux Mint](/distribution/linuxmint).
- I was not able to play a .mp4 file with the Parole Media Player, included by default. It offers to install additional codecs when I open a .mp4 file, but nothing happens if I ask to install the same. This problem may be a Tumbleweed issue or a live image specific issue. I was able to play .mp3 file with the default music player included.
