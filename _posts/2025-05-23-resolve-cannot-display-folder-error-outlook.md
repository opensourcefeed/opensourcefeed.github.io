One of such issues that interrupts the smooth functioning of this email client is the error message saying **"Cannot Display the Folder."** It could be the reason why you are not receiving emails in Outlook. This error happens when the application is unable to open a folder within the mailbox content. 

There can be multiple reasons for this issue. Sometimes the error happens due to permission or server-related reasons, while in majority of cases the culprits behind this error are a corrupt Outlook profile and an oversized Outlook data file (.pst). This post will guide you through how to resolve the 'Cannot Display the Folder' error in Outlook efficiently. We will discuss possible reasons and solutions for this issue. Additionally, we will also explore a [professional PST recovery software](https://www.stellarinfo.com/outlook-pst-file-recovery.php). 

## Understanding the Error

In this part of the post, we will unearth possible factors that can lead to the 'Cannot Display the Folder' error in Outlook. Some common reasons that can trigger this error are discussed below:

### A Corrupt Profile
If the user’s Outlook profile got corrupted due to any virus attack or other reason, its ability to access and read folder information gets reduced, leading to this error. 

### Hardware Issue
If the hard disk where the Outlook data file (.pst) is stored contains bad sectors, it can severely hamper the system’s capability to access and read data.

### Sudden Outlook Exit
Terminating Outlook suddenly can disturb synchronization with the email server and leave folder data in an inconsistent state.

### PST File Corruption
Corruption in the Outlook data file (.pst) disturbs folder hierarchy or file structure, preventing Outlook from accessing it.

### Add-In Interference
Third-party add-ins may interfere with default Outlook behavior, causing such errors.

### Permissions
Lack of proper folder permissions may prevent access to folder content.
