**The** EndeavourOS team has announced the release of EndeavourOS Mercury (2025.02.08), a new ISO image for fresh installations.  While the team acknowledges a less frequent release schedule due to real-life commitments, they reassure users that EndeavourOS remains active and committed.  Hotfixes are regularly applied to existing ISOs, ensuring they remain functional.

This release focuses on improving the new install experience and live environment.  Running systems do *not* need to "upgrade" to Mercury; regular system updates will keep them current.

## Key Highlights of EndeavourOS Mercury

> * **Updated Packages:**  Mercury ships with updated packages, including:
    * Calamares 25.02.1.4-3
    * Firefox 135.0-1
    * Linux Kernel 6.13.1.arch2-1
    * Mesa 1:24.3.4-1
    * Xorg-server 21.1.15-1
    * Nvidia 570.86.16-3
* **Improved Installer and Live Environment:** Several key improvements have been implemented:
    * Memory test now available for EFI.
    * Bios/Legacy install issues resolved.
    * Default dark theme for KDE, Gnome, XFCE4, Mate, Budgie, and Cinnamon desktops.
    * XFCE4 theme closer to the default Xfce setup.
    * Gnome automatically sets dark/light wallpapers based on mode.
    * "Replace Partition" option now correctly handles empty space.
    * Duplicate EFI selection entries in the installer fixed.
    * Easier access to EndeavourOS branding resources: [https://github.com/endeavouros-team/Branding](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/Branding)
    * Mirrorlists are now ranked *before* installation and copied to the target system.  User-modified mirrorlists during the live session will be used instead of re-ranking.
