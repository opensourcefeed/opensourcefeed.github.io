## MATE to leave, Xfce to Join.
In the official release announcement, the Solus team has updated on their plan to deprecate the Solus MATE edition. The decision is considering the lack of compatibility and support of the MATE desktop with future technologies such as Wayland and Pipewire. Solus 4.4 will be the last Solus release to ship a MATE edition.

Going forward, the Solus project will ship an Xfce flavor for users who prefer a lightweight, modern and traditional looking desktop environment. Xfce is more focused to enable compatiblilty with upcoming technological enhancements such as Wayland and Pipewire.
