### Enhances the Microsoft Office experience

Zorin OS 16.2 tackles this problem by using open-source fonts those are close enough to windows fonts.

### LibreOffice 7.4 improves the productivity further
For those who don't want to use proprietary office suites, the LibreOffice 7.4 is available in Zorin OS 16.2. It improves the overall office suite experience and boosts productivity.
