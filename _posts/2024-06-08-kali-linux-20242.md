## What's new in Kali Linux 2024.2?

The following section briefly explores the key highlights of Kali Linux 2024.2.

### t64 Transition

> #### What is t64 issue?
> 
> Computers keep track of time using seconds since a specific point, January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC, called the Unix Epoch. A special data type in C, `time_t`, stores these seconds. Older systems with 32-bit `time_t` have a limited counter that could overflow in the year 2038, causing issues. `t64` stands for "64-bit time_t" and offers a larger counter to prevent this problem for a much longer time.


Kali Linux 2024.2 inherits the t64 issue fix from the Debian. The t64 transition updates the time_t type to 64-bit for ARM architectures to prevent the Year 2038 issue. Most users on amd64 or arm64 won't notice any change, but those on 32-bit ARM boards should use `apt full-upgrade` to avoid potential issues.

### Desktop Enhancements

#### GNOME 46

Kali Linux 2024.2 features GNOME 46, delivering a refined desktop experience with updated themes and extensions.

#### Xfce Updates

Xfce has received enhancements for Kali-Undercover and HiDPI modes, ensuring better stability and support for modern desktops.


### New Tools

Kali 2024.2 includes 18 new tools such as autorecon, getsploit, and snort, alongside numerous updates to existing ones, keeping Kali at the forefront of security toolkits.

### NetHunter and ARM

NetHunter now supports Android 14 and features new kernels for devices like the Nothing Phone 1. ARM support has been updated for the Raspberry Pi 5 and Gateworks Newport, but support for Gateworks Ventana has been discontinued.
