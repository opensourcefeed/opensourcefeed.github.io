description: Explore the artistic evolution of Fedora wallpapers, from Fedora Core 1 to the cutting-edge Fedora 40.
---

**The** default wallpaper is often the first impression a user has of a new operating system. For beginner-friendly distributions like Fedora, an attractive and welcoming default wallpaper can be a key factor.

Fedora strikes a balance between catering to newcomers and experienced users. Each release boasts a unique default wallpaper, accompanied by a selection of additional options. Let's embark on a journey through Fedora's history, exploring how the default wallpapers have visually evolved since the very first iteration, Fedora Core 1.
