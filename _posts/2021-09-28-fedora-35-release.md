## What is new in Fedora 35 BETA?

Following are the salient features in Fedora 35 BETA release.

> - Fedora 35 Workstation includes GNOME 41 - the latest stable release from the popular desktop project. Probably, Fedora 35 Workstation will be the first regular distribution to ship GNOME 41 by default. GNOME 41 includes redesigned Software App and other configuration options.
- Fedora 35 introduces Fedora Kinoite = a KDE Plasma environment based on rpm-ostree technology. Like Fedora Silverblue, Kinoite provides atomic updates and an immutable operating system for increased reliability.
- Fedora 35 BETA build keeps WirePlumber as the default session manager. WirePlumber enables customization of rules for routing streams to and from devices.
