## What is new in Fedora 39 Beta?

In certain respects, the Fedora 39 Beta release is notable for the absence of anticipated features. The initial plan for introducing a swifter version of the DNF package manager and revealing a redesigned user interface for Anaconda, the installation program - was dropped to allow more time for these developments to reach maturity.

üñ•Ô∏è Fedora Workstation 39 Beta: Featuring GNOME 45 (currently in beta) and LibreOffice 7.6, tailored to those requiring a free and open-source desktop suite.

‚òÅÔ∏è Fedora Cloud 39 Beta: Now defaults to cost-efficient gp3 storage volumes for AWS users.

üîß Other Updates: Anticipate improvements in the GNU Toolchain, encompassing GCC 13.2, binutils 2.40, glibc 2.38, and gdb 13.2. These updates equip developers with cutting-edge tools and enhance security and performance for the entire Fedora Linux user community.
