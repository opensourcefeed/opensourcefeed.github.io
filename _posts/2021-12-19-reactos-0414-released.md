ReactOS 0.4.14 is a result of 1 year of development and regression effort. It does not include many of the latest development updates announced in 2021, but it includes several regression fixes and patches to provide a more solid experience. Those who prefer to explore the latest enhancements instead of a robust experience can try the nightly builds.

## What is new in ReactOS 0.4.14?
The key features in the ReactOS 0.4.14 release are as follows.
> - The shell introduces a 'Send To' feature with which files can be sent to a predefined location with the right-click. Also, there are options for opening file location of shortcuts and for opening terminal anywhere with the right-click menu.
- Introduces NEC PC-9800 boot support. NEC PC-9800 (or PC-98 in short) is a series of 16-bit and 32-bit Japanese computers developed and manufactured by NEC. As that type of hardware is based on x86 processors, it is a relatively easy porting target.
- Improvements in ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) which range from the implementation of the IOCTL_ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST I/O control code to a full rewrite of the Icmp** routines.
- Improvements and enhancemnets to the kernel to increase the overall robustiness of the system.
- Introduces support for booting Linux 64-bit systems in 64-bit FreeLoader and fixed an issue where FreeLoader couldnâ€™t read from an EXT2 volume, hence preventing booting.
- Reduced memory footprint due to obsolete fonts being removed (116 MB to 92 MB)
