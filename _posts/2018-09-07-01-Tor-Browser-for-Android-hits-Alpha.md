**For** the last one decade, mobile internet browsing is on the rise. In certain parts of the world, mobile is the most common platform used to access the internet. While there are a lot of surveillance projects to track the mobile Internet usage. This is a serious question against individual privacy and anonymity. The tor project is working on this issue for a while. So, we have Tor Browser for Android now.

The Tor project has announced the availability of Tor Browser for Android alpha release. This is the first time Tor project introducing the browser for Android. Presently, there is *Orfox*, a browser that routes network through *Orbot*. This project will be decommissioned once the Tor browser hits the stable release.

The Tor Browser alpha release is available on Google Play Store. The APK is also available directly from [Tor website](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha). Presently, the Tor Browser for Android requires Orbot to establish the connection through the Tor network. The final stable release will eliminate the dependency of Orbot, and users can directly browse with Tor Browser.

The main features of Tor Browser for Android can be summarized as,
> - BLOCK TRACKERS: Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can’t follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you’re done browsing.
- DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE: Prevent someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you’re using Tor.
- RESIST FINGERPRINTING: Tor aims to make all users look the same, so Tor Browser for Android makes it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information.
- MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION: When you use Tor Browser for Android, your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. Watch this animation to learn more about how it works.
- BROWSE FREELY: With Tor Browser for Android, you are free to access sites your local internet service provider may have blocked.
