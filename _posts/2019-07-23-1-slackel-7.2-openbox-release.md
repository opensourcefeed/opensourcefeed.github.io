Slackel 7.2 introduces a set of GUI based tools to easily create and transfer Slackel ISO images. These tools help to create bootable Slackel pendrive, and also facilitates dual booting with Slackel and Salix images.

The *instonusb* tool helps to create bootable pendrive with 32 and 64 bit flavors of Slackel. It also allows to create persistent file in pendrive.

The *multiboot* tool is for creating USB with both 32 and 64 bit flavors of Slackel and Salix. While booting the system, users can choose any of these.

*Slackel Live Installer* helps to easily install the system. This provides a useable GUI which under the hood invokes slackware-live script for installing the system.

More details on Slackel 7.2 release is available on Slackel forums.
