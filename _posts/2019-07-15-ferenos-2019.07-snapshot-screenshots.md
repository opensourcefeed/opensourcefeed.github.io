The visible highlights in feren OS 2019.07 release are captured below.
- Just like in previous snapshots, this release also brings some fresh wallpapers. Some of these wallpapers are intended for upcoming *feren OS NEXT*.
- The *Inspire* icon theme, which is default in feren OS, is restructured and it includes some new icons.
- The feren OS repository keyring is updated as the old keyring was accidentally deleted by the author. This change might require some manual intervention if trying to update from an existing installation.
- The boot screen is updated with a KDE neon inspired theme. It fixes some dirty issues discovered with the previous boot screen. Still, if you fancy old boot screen, you can install it from repositories.

## Changes in feren OS NEXT
Feren OS NEXT is an experimental snapshot of feren OS. It features Plasma Desktop with the *good qualities* of feren OS. With this release, feren OS NEXT is marked as beta, which is another footstep towards the final release.
