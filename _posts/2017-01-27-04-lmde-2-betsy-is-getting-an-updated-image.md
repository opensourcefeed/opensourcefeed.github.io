For those who are not familiar with LMDE, it is a [Debian](/distribution/debian) based, semi-rolling GNU/Linux distribution developed by [Linux Mint](/distribution/linuxmint) team. It features Cinnamon & MATE Desktops as official Linux Mint releases, but the difference is in its rolling behavior.

Being a rolling distribution, LMDE 2 has got several major and minor updates over past two years. This includes updates MATE & Cinnamon desktops and updated linux kernels. All these updates will be available in new installation media.

For original announcement and discussions on updated image of LMDE 2, see [projects blog](http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3212).
