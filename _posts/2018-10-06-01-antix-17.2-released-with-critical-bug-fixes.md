### What is new in antiX 17.2?
As a minor update in antiX 17.x series, there is no long list of features for antiX 17.2. The main highlights in antiX 17.2 are as follows.
> - Linux Kernel 4.9.126 kernel patched for L1TF/Foreshadow and Meltdown/Spectre exploits
- all packages upgraded to Debian 9.5
- eudev updated to 3.6
- firefox-esr upgraded to 60.2.2 (Quantum)
- our nosystemd version of pulseaudio included
- nonfree debs moved from main to nonfree in antiX repos
- improved localization
- antiX-full – gz compression is used, which makes the live iso faster to boot, but bigger in size

### Availability
As usual, antiX comes in 4 different varieties. Each variety has both 32-bit and 64-bit specific images. The 32-bit images make use of non-PAE Kernel, which limits the ability to use RAM above 4 GB. These images are free from *systemd* - an init process used to boot the system and to run system processes. The antiX 17.2 includes,
> - antiX-full (c1GB) – 4 windows managers – IceWM (default), Fluxbox, jwm and herbstluftwm plus full LibreOffice suite.
- antiX-base (c680MB so fits on a cd) – 4 windows managers – IceWM (default), Fluxbox, jwm, and herbstluftwm.
- antiX-core (c330MB) – no X, but should support most wireless.
- antiX-net (c170MB)- no X. Just enough to get you connected (wired) and ready to build.
