## ZSH is the default shell now.
In the previous release, Kali Linux 2020.3, the ZSH shell was provided as an alternative shell. Also, the team informed their decision to switch to ZSH as the default shell.

With the release of Kali Linux 2020.4, ZSH is now the default shell in desktop and cloud images. It will offer better and user-friendly options with more configuration options. Those who don't prefer ZSH can switch to bash with a single command.

For now, bash will continue as the default shell in ARM, container, Nethunter, and WSL images.

## Other highlights
There is a makeover for shell themes. The look and feel remain the same now in both bash and ZSH. The root account will be highlighted with a red color, and the user account will be highlighted with a blue color.
Partnership with byt3bl33d3râ€™s CrackMapExec allows Kali to respect the software license policies.
Package updates & new tools.
