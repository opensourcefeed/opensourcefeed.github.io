**Kerala**, a southern state in India, has consistently led the way in embracing free and open-source software (FOSS) across various sectors. Since 2006, the state has championed a transition to open technologies, reflecting its commitment to sustainable and accessible digital development. This movement is most evident in the education sector, where the government has seamlessly integrated FOSS into its school curricula.

## Open Source: A Cornerstone of Kerala's Education

From primary school onwards, Kerala students are encouraged to explore technology through open-source tools. The curriculum not only introduces them to software for daily activities like word processing, painting, and multimedia but also includes Python programming in the 10th standard. This initiative allows students to build practical coding skills while nurturing an early interest in software development.

## The Genesis of KITE GNU/Linux

The idea of a custom Linux operating system for schools took shape in the mid-2000s. By 2006, Kerala had launched IT@School GNU/Linux, a Debian-based platform tailored for education. Over time, the project evolved into KITE GNU/Linux, with "KITE" representing Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education.

KITE, a government body dedicated to modernizing education through technology, now oversees this project. The OS has become an integral part of school IT programs, and in 2008, Kerala students made history by completing their public IT practical exams using GNU/Linux systems.

The latest iteration, KITE GNU/Linux 22.04, builds on this legacy. Based on Ubuntu LTS, it offers a robust and user-friendly environment for students, educators, and professionals. For schools with older hardware, a lightweight version—KITE Linux Lite—is also available.

## Features of KITE GNU/Linux 22.04

This open-source OS comes with a suite of tools designed to meet diverse needs:
> - Educational Software: Includes applications like GCompris, Tux Paint, PictoBlox, and Scratch, offering engaging platforms for learning.
