Korora team has already prepared a few experimental ISOs and has started working on layouts for various spins, and ISO testing is also in progress. Once everything is set, Korora 27 will be officially announced.

From official statement made by Korora team:
> For our next release, Korora 27, we have decided that the codename will be "Marlin" which continues the tradition of having codenames based on characters from "Finding Nemo". The development on Korora 27 is in full progress, this involves fixing the layouts on a couple of our spins and of course building and testing iso’s which is done by the team. Once we are satisfied and everything works as should the final iso’s will be build, tested and released. For the upcoming release we are using Canvas to build, maintain our ISO's and much more.
