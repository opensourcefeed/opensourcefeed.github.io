## What's New in Zorin OS 17

### Faster and Smoother Performance
Zorin OS 17 prioritizes speed, delivering a dramatically snappier desktop experience across a broad spectrum of hardware, both old and new. Performance optimizations, from the kernel to the desktop environment, ensure that apps open faster, animations are smoother, and loading times are minimized. Remarkably, we've lowered the minimum system requirements from 2 GB of RAM to just 1Â½ GB, making Zorin OS 17 ideal for breathing new life into older and low-spec computers.

### Universal Search and Zorin Menu Improvements
The Zorin Menu has undergone a transformation for faster navigation. Enjoy universal search functionality, enabling you to find files, calendar appointments, contacts, apps, and even use it as a calculator. The revamped menu also includes an "All Apps" category for easy alphabetical browsing.

### Multitasking Redefined
Zorin OS 17 introduces a refined activities overview, making multitasking seamless. Workspaces are now arranged horizontally, and a 3D Spatial Desktop adds a new dimension to your computing experience.

### Refreshed Software Store
The Software store is now significantly faster, featuring a beautiful new design and improved app details pages. Zorin OS 17 supports APT, Snap, Flatpak, AppImage, .deb, and even Windows software (.exe and .msi installers with Windows App Support), providing the broadest app support ever.

### Advanced Window Tiling
Addressing a key user request, Zorin OS 17 introduces an advanced window-tiling experience, catering to power users. Enable quarter screen corner tiling, keyboard shortcuts, and custom tiling layouts for a more tailored workspace.

Capturing and sharing your screen is now easier with the redesigned screenshot interface. Access it with a press of the Print Screen key or from the Quick Settings menu for a seamless experience.

### Redesigned Weather App
The weather app boasts a completely redesigned interface, offering detailed Hourly and Daily forecasts for the next 10 days. Weather data is integrated throughout the desktop for smarter event planning.
