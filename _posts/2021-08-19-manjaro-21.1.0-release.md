The Manjaro 21.1.0 release announcement includes the official editions GNOME, KDE Plasma, and Xfce.

The noteworthy highlights in Manjaro 21 1.0 release are as follows.

> - Manjaro 21.1.0 brings several improvements to Calamares. It includes filesystem selection for automatic partitioning and enhanced support for brtfs. For brtfs, the default subvolume layout is optimized for easier rollback and effective space utilization. Also, brtfs can now support swap space.
- GNOME 40. The default layout more closely follows upstream. For those who prefer the old vertical desktop layout, the Manjaro legacy layout is available in gnome-layout-switcher.
- Firefox appearance is now more consistent with GNOME with a custom theme. This theme can be disabled in gnome-layout-switcher.
- The Plasma edition comes with the latest Plasma 5.22 series, Frameworks 5.85, and Applications (Gear) 21.08. Also, the default theme is updated to match more with the upstream. Plasma Wayland change is continuing in full swing.
- Manjaro 21.1.0 Xfce Edition comes with Xfce 4.16.
- Linux Kernel 5.13 is the default Kernel available. Also, there are minimal ISOs with Linux Kernel 5.4 LTS which offers additional support for older hardware.
