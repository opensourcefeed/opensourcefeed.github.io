## It is not based on Debian 10 yet!

Debian 10 is there for a while now. Still, Slax is not rebased to Debian. Mr *Tomas* - the Slax Developer - is doing some groundworks for moving to Debian 10. It will take some more time as there are multiple things to manage when rebasing the distribution. Till then, Slax releases will be based on Debian *Jessy* only.

## What changed in Slax 9.11.0?
As a minor release, there is not much to explain about Slax 9.11.0 features. The main changes are listed below.

> - Updated to most recent packages from Debian stretch
- Disabled screen blanking on console and for X
- Fixed PXE server script '/usr/bin/pxe' to pick first gateway if there are more than one configured
