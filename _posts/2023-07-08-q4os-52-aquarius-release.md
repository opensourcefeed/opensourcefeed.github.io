## Lightweight and Reliable Debian-Based OS:

Q4OS Aquarius is a Debian-based operating system that aims to provide a stable and lightweight user experience. Leveraging unique Q4OS tools, this OS offers added value to its users. The default appearance retains the Debian stock Plasma desktop, but users who prefer the Q4OS brand can easily switch to the Q4OS dedicated Debonaire theme in system settings. Additionally, the exclusive Desktop Profiler tool allows users to create custom profiles, enabling easy installation and configuration of pre-defined sets of applications and packages.

## Coexistence of Plasma and Trinity Desktops:

Q4OS ensures that users can install and use both the advanced Plasma and efficient Trinity desktop environments side by side without any conflicts. Whether you require the feature-rich Plasma or the resource-friendly Trinity, you can seamlessly switch between them. Plasma is set as the default option, catering to the preferences of most users.

Stability is a primary goal for Q4OS. Whether you're a company or an individual, Q4OS aims to deliver a reliable operating system. Once installed and configured, Q4OS Aquarius will function smoothly, receiving necessary security fixes and updates. To maintain stability, the integration of new features into the core system will be limited to exceptional cases.
