**The** 4MLinux team has announced the release of 4MLinux 29.0. As usual, it provides maintenance (by using it as a system rescue live CD), multimedia (for example, for playing video DVDs), miniserver (using the inetd daemon), and mystery suites.

As a major release, 4MLinux 29.0 include some noteworthy changes.
- Audacious audio player is available out of the box.
- A new desktop ‬sub-menu called *Office* ‭‬with applications like AbiWord, Gnumeric, LazPaint
- spellcheck functionality added to Sylpheed and HexChat
- The LibreOffice installation script is improved
- better support for MINIX file system (via ‬util-linux‭ and GParted)‬
- much improved ‬3D acceleration in Quake2.
- The 4MServer now includes PHP 7.3 with NaCl cryptography support.

Following are some screenshots capture in 4MLinux 29.0 release. I could not capture the screenshot of application menu and other menu items due to the limitation of default screenshot tool and lack of option to install other tools.
