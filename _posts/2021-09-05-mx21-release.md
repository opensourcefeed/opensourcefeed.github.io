**On** 5th September 2021, the MX Linux team has announced the availability of MX-21 BETA 2 for testing. The MX-21 BETA release includes Xfce, Fluxbox, and KDE Plasma flavors. The MX-21 release inherits from the Debian Bullseye branch, and it also contains package updates from both Bullseye and MX package repositories.

The significant highlights in the MX-21 BETA release are as follows:
> - Xfce 4.16, Plasma 5.20, Fluxbox 1.3.7 with MX-Fluxbox 3.0 configs
- User password (sudo) for admin tasks by default. You can switch this in MX-tweak -> Other tab.
- New UEFI live system boot menus. Now users can select their live boot options (persistence, etcâ€¦) from the boot menu and submenus rather than using the previous console menus.
