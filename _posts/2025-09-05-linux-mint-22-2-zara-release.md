Based on the **Ubuntu Noble** package base and powered by a **Linux kernel 6.14**, Linux Mint 22.2 "Zara" introduces a host of new features and refinements that enhance the overall user experience.

## What's New in This Release? âœ¨

This version of Linux Mint is focused on enhancing existing applications and introducing new tools for improved functionality. Key updates include:

* **Sticky Notes:** The popular Sticky Notes app has been modernized with rounded corners and now supports the **Wayland display server**, ensuring it works seamlessly with the latest technologies.
* **Hypnotix:** The TV viewing application, Hypnotix, has been upgraded with new display options like **"Theater Mode"** and **"Borderless Mode"**, along with performance enhancements for faster startup and searching.
* **Fingwit Fingerprint Manager:** A brand-new XApp called **Fingwit** has been introduced for simplified fingerprint authentication. This tool allows you to easily set up your fingerprint to unlock the screen, authenticate `sudo` commands, and access administrative applications.
* **libAdwaita Compatibility:** Linux Mint 22.2 now has improved compatibility with **`libAdwaita`**, a library used by many modern applications. With this update, `libAdwaita` apps, including Flatpaks, will now follow your system's theme and even adopt your chosen accent colors, creating a more cohesive look and feel.
* **Visual and Performance Tweaks:** The default artwork now has a subtle hint of blue, giving the desktop a softer and more modern aesthetic. Additionally, the **Software Manager** has an improved welcome screen to help users better understand the difference between Flatpak and system packages, and the **Update Manager** now provides a handy reboot button when an update requires it.
