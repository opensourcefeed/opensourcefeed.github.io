**openSUSE** is an independently developed, enterprise quality distribution backed by SUSE Foundation. In addition to all benefits of regular GNU/Linux distribution, it comes with powerful system administration and configuration tools like YaST - a comprehensive linux system configuration and installation, OBS - Open Build Service, build tool supporting builds for openSUSE itself and other main stream distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian ..etc.

openSUSE comes in two different flavors. The *Leap* edition is an extremely stable, conservative, professional quality distribution. It shares core packages with SUSE Enterprise Linux(SEL) and enjoys support from dedicated community members. While, the *TumbleWeed* edition is a rolling edition with bleeding edge technologies.
