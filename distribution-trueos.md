**TrueOS** (earlier, PC-BSD or BSD) is a BSD distribution that inherits the tradition of security and stability from FreeBSD, an independent BSD distribution. It also includes the latest drivers, security and package updates from the FreeBSD-CURRENT branch.

The main highlights of TrueOS includes:
- A brand new driver package shipped with TrueOS provides support for newer Intel graphics chipsets and hardware
- *PersonalCrypt* allows to encrypt user home directory and to take it to other TrueOS machines.
- GELI full disk encryption support which ensures the safety of data even in case of physical theft.
- Full clang functionality built from ports
