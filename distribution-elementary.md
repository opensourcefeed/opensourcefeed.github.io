**elementary OS** is a free and open-source Linux operating system based on Ubuntu LTS. It focuses on ease of use, speed, and user privacy. The system suits new Linux users and people who want a clean desktop.

The operating system uses the Pantheon desktop. Pantheon has a simple layout and clear menus. The interface feels familiar to users coming from Windows or macOS. The desktop stays responsive on modest hardware.

elementary OS includes a set of core applications made for the system. These apps follow the same design rules and work well together.

- **AppCenter** lets users install and update software. It supports optional payments to developers.
- **Files** manages folders and documents.
- **Music** plays audio files.
- **Videos** plays video files.
- **Photos** helps organize images.
- **Mail** handles email accounts.

Privacy is a core part of elementary OS. The system avoids tracking. It limits background activity. Users control app permissions. Security updates come from Ubuntu long-term support releases.

elementary OS works well for daily tasks such as web browsing, office work, media playback, and email. It offers a stable and predictable experience without extra complexity.
