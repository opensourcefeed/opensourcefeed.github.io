- AppCenter - A lightweight and user-friendly package manager that makes installing, updating, and managing software a breeze.
- Files - File Manager
- Videos - Video Player
- Music - Music Player
- Photos - Image Manager
- Mail - Email client.

Overall, elementary OS is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a fast, simple, and visually appealing operating system that is built on a solid and reliable foundation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, elementary OS offers a seamless and enjoyable computing experience.
