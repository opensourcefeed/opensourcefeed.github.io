**feren OS** is a traditional looking, modern desktop environment built on top Linux Mint. It offers a well customized Cinnamon Desktop without compromising productivity.

The main objective of feren OS is to provide a friendly experience to people migrating from other proprietary platforms like windows and macOS.

feren OS ships WINE by default, to provide support for windows binary applications, which is one of the key point windows migrants looks on GNU/Linux platforms.

Instead of delivering a vanilla Cinnamon experience, feren OS ships client side decoration enabled applications from GNOME world to provide a delightful experience to users.

Beginning from August 2017, feren OS team has decided to switch to a rolling release model. As the beginning of this, an updated snapshot was released in August 2017.
