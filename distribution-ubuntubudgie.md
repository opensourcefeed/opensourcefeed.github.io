**Ubuntu Budgie** was started as an unofficial remix of Ubuntu on 2016. By end of the year, it was recognized as an official community flavor of Ubuntu. It combines solid Ubuntu core with elegant, efficient and productive budgie desktop  developed by Solus project.

Ubuntu Budgie project does a fair amount of customization on vanilla budgie desktop to make it more appealing to end users and ships numerous applications that will have great value in day to day activities.
