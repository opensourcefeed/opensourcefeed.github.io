**Linux Lite** is a lightweight operating system based on Ubuntu Long Term Supported (LTS) releases. This distribution features a highly customized Xfce desktop environment with a fresh look & feel.

Unlike many other GNU/Linux distributions, Linux Lite is not bloated with many packages and tools. Instead, it includes a single software for a specific purpose. 

In order to provide a better desktop experience, Linux Lite ships a collection of custom made tools. These tools includes Lite Welcome, Lite Users, Lite Software, Lite Notification ..etc
