**Linux Lite** is a lightweight operating system based on Ubuntu Long Term Supported (LTS) releases. This distribution features a highly customized Xfce desktop environment that comes with a fresh look & feel.

Unlike many other GNU/Linux distributions, Linux Lite is not bloated with many packages and tools, instead it includes a single software for a specific purpose. Linux Lite includes tools like Lite Software, User Manager, Lite Configuration Center ..etc to provide a better desktop experience.
