**Linux Lite** is a lightweight operating system based on Ubuntu Long Term Supported (LTS) releases. This distribution features a highly customized Xfce desktop environment that comes with a fresh look & feel.

Unlike many other GNU/Linux distributions, Linux Lite is not bloated with many packages and tools, instead, it includes a single software for a specific purpose. Linux Lite includes tools like *Lite Tweaks*, *Lite Software*, *Lite User*, *Lite Configuration Center* ..etc to provide a better desktop experience.
