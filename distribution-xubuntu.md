**Xubuntu** is a full featured, yet lightweight and resource efficient GNU/Linux distribution. Built on top of Ubuntu core, it provides a reliable, stable and secure platform along with Xfce Desktop environment.

Xubuntu is one among the early members of official community flavors of Ubuntu and has a fair amount of user base. It is mainly choosen by people having older systems, notebooks or who don't like the *complexities* of other main stream desktop environments.

Instead of providing vanilla Xfce Desktop, Xubuntu ships a fairly custmoized version of Xfce. These customizations includes, but not limited to, a professional looking icon and Gtk theme, Whisker application menu, and a set of beautiful wallpapers.

There is another variation of Xubuntu called, Xubuntu Core. It is a minimal version of Xubuntu with vanilla Xfce desktop
