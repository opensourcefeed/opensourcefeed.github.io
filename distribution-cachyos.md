**CachyOS** is a highly optimized and performance-driven Linux distribution based on Arch Linux. It is designed for users who seek a fast, secure, and customizable computing experience while benefiting from an easy installation process.

### Flexible Desktop Environment Choices
CachyOS offers a variety of desktop environments and window managers to suit different user preferences. During installation, users can select from popular options such as KDE Plasma, GNOME, XFCE, i3WM, Wayfire, LXQt, OpenBox, Cinnamon, UKUI, LXDE, Mate, Budgie, Qtile, Hyprland, and Sway. This flexibility ensures that users can tailor their system to their workflow and aesthetic preferences.

### Optimized Web Browsing with Cachy-Browser
CachyOS comes with Cachy-Browser, a privacy-focused and performance-enhanced fork of Firefox. While inspired by security-oriented browsers like LibreWolf, Cachy-Browser features unique optimizations for a smoother and more secure browsing experience.

### Easy Installation Options
To accommodate different user preferences, CachyOS provides two installation methods:
- **Graphical Installer**: A user-friendly GUI installer based on Calamares, making installation straightforward.
- **CLI Installer**: A command-line-based installation for users who prefer more control over system setup.

### Performance Enhancements in CachyOS
CachyOS is built for speed and efficiency, leveraging advanced optimizations such as:
- **Custom Linux Kernel**: The **linux-cachyos kernel** is optimized for modern hardware, ensuring maximum performance and stability.
- **BORE Scheduler and Alternatives**: While BORE is available for improved interactivity, users can choose from other schedulers like EEVDF, sched-ext, ECHO, and RT based on their workload needs.
- **Optimized Compiling**: Packages are compiled using x86-64-v3, x86-64-v4, and Zen4 instruction sets, along with LTO (Link Time Optimization), PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization), and BOLT (Binary Optimization and Layout Tool) for enhanced performance.

### Why Choose CachyOS?
- **Performance-focused**: Advanced kernel tweaks and optimized package compilation ensure speed and efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Choose from a wide range of desktop environments and schedulers to fit your needs.
- **Secure and Private**: Enhanced security features in both the browser and system architecture.
- **User-Friendly Installation**: The GUI installer simplifies setup, while advanced users can opt for the CLI method.
