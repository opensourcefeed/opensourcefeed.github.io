**Linux Kodachi** is a Debian based operating system that provides a secure, anti forensic,
and anonymous operating system considering all features that a person who is concerned about privacy
would need to have in order to be secure.

Kodachi is very easy to use all you have to do is boot it up on your PC via USB drive then you should 
have a fully running operating system with established VPN connection + Tor Connection established + 
DNScrypt service running.
