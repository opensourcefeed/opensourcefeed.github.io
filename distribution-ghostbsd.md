**GhostBSD** is a simple and elegant TrueOS-based distribution. In addition to the core values of TrueOS, GhostBSD brings pre-installed GUI and applications to make things easier for desktop users.

GhostBSD includes a simple installer, a desktop environment,  and user-friendly package management. It also provides out-of-the-box multimedia support with pre-installed codecs.

Previously, the GhostBSD was based on FreeBSD. In May 2018, the team decided to switch the base in favor of TrueOS. The transition was initially implemented in the GhostBSD 18.10 release.
