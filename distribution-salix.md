**Salix** is a Slackware-based GNU/Linux distribution that inherits the core benefits of Slackware and offers a user-friendly experience. In addition to the friendly installer, Salix offers a pre-installed Xfce desktop environment, easy package management tools, and flatpack support.

Unlike many modern distributions, Salix offers both 32-bit and 64-bit flavors.
