**Budgie** is a modern desktop environment developed by Solus Project. The main focus of the budgie desktop is simplicity and elegance. It is independently developed from scratch to provide optimal performance and a traditional user experience without compromising productivity and user-friendliness.

Currently, the Budgie desktop integrates closely with the GNOME stack, utilizing GNOME components wherever possible without adding its complexity.

Though budgie is the flagship desktop for Solus, it is also available for other major GNU/Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, Cinnamon ..etc.

Initially, the Solus project developed the Budgie desktop. Later, it evolved into an indepdendnet desktop project under the banner of *Buddies of Budgie*.
