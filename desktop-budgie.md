**Budgie** is a desktop environment for GNU/Linux and similar operating systems. Its main objective is to provide users with a simple and elegant desktop experience, while ensuring optimal performance and productivity. 

One of the key features of Budgie is its traditional user interface that is familiar and user-friendly. It uses a simple and intuitive design that makes it easy to use and navigate, even for novice users. At the same time, it provides advanced customization options and a variety of settings that allow users to tailor the desktop environment to their specific needs.

Budgie tightly integrates with the GNOME stack, which is one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux. This means that it utilizes many of the components and tools that are available in GNOME, making it easy to use and reliable. However, Budgie has been designed to be less complex and more lightweight than GNOME, which helps to ensure faster performance and better stability.

Budgie was originally developed as part of the Solus project. Later, it evolved into an independent project under the banner of *Buddies of Budgie*.

The Budgie desktop environment is available on a wide variety of Linux-based operating systems, including some of the most popular distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux. 

In conclusion, Budgie is a modern desktop environment that provides a simple and elegant user interface for Linux-based operating systems. It is designed to be user-friendly, customizable, and lightweight, while also providing advanced features and tools for power users. Its tight integration with the GNOME stack and independent development make it a reliable and popular choice for users who want a fast and stable desktop environment.
