**Solus** is an independent Linux distribution built for personal computers. It aims to provide a simple, stable, and consistent desktop experience. The system ships with well-tested packages and a clear focus on desktop use instead of servers or enterprise workloads.

## Desktop Environments

Solus offers four desktop environments: **Budgie**, **GNOME**, **Xfce**, and **KDE Plasma**. Budgie is the flagship environment and uses GNOME technologies under the hood. Each option is tuned to work well on everyday hardware and gives users a clean and predictable interface.

## Software and Use Cases

Solus includes software for daily tasks such as office work, web browsing, and media playback. It supports gaming through tools like Steam and Lutris. Developers can access compilers, editors, and other tools from the repository.

## Release Model

Solus follows a curated rolling release model. Users receive updates on a regular schedule, and new packages are tested before they reach the stable repository. This approach keeps the system current while reducing the risk of breakage.

## Discontinued Editions

The **MATE edition is discontinued** as of Solus 4.4.
