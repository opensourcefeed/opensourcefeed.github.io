**Solus** is an independently developed GNU/Linux distribution that is designed for modern personal 
computing devices, every tweak enabling us to deliver a singular, cohesive desktop experience.

Solus is built from scratch and supported by the community, providing us the freedom to provide the 
best experience without being beholden to the interests of other projects or corporate agendas.
