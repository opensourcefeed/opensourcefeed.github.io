**Chakra** - is a semi-rolling GNU/Linux distribution which was initially started as a fork of [Arch Linux](/distribution/arch). Later it has evolved into an independent GNU/Linux distribution with it's own package maitenance system. Chakra employes a semi-rolling release model, which means it will be having a periodically updated stable core and latest plasma desktop and other Qt related technologies.

The team [officially announced the discontinuation of the project](https://twitter.com/chakralinux/status/1475111596640727045) on 26th December 2021.
