**antiX** is a fast, lightweight and systemd-free live distribution based on Debian. It provides a *special* eco-system called *antiX Magic* to work with both old and new computers.

The objective of antiX is to provide a lightweight and fully functional operating system for beginners and advanced users alike. It can work smoothly on most of the systems having at least 256 MB of RAM.

As a live distribution, antiX can be used for system rescue activities. It runs smoothly on live boot and can work with or without persistence.

There are 4 different varieties of antiX.
- **antiX-full** comes with 4 windows managers – IceWM (default), Fluxbox, jwm and herbstluftwm plus full LibreOffice suite.
- **antiX-base** also includes 4 windows managers – IceWM (default), Fluxbox, jwm, and herbstluftwm.
- **antiX-core** comes without any window manager but will support most wireless devices.
- **antiX-net** provides minimal configuration required to connect with the net and then helps to build a custom system.
