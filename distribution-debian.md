The Debian project was started in August 1993 by Ian Murdock. The main idea objective behind the Debian is to create a free operating system following the principles of GNU and Linux. Debian started as a small, tightly knit group of Free Software hackers and gradually evolved to a large, well-organized community of developers and users.

Debian works as a parent for many GNU/Linux distribution, including Ubuntu. The operating systems inheriting from Debian enjoys large collection of packages from the Debian reposistories.
