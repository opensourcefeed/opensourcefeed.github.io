**Debian** - *The Universal Operating System* is an independently developed GNU/Linux distribution. It is probably the biggest operating system in terms of the number of packages, contributors and the number of distributions derived from it.

The Debian project was started in August 1993 by Ian Murdock, as a new distribution which would be made openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU. Debian was meant to be carefully and conscientiously put together and to be maintained and supported with similar care. It started as a small, tightly knit group of Free Software hackers, and gradually grew to become a large, well-organized community of developers and users.
