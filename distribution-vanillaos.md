**Vanilla OS** is an Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux distribution with a vanilla GNOME desktop combined with a solid and productive core system.

Vanilla OS offers the latest stable Linux kernel, ensuring support for the latest devices and performance improvements. With the integrated driver manager, Vanilla OS helps to install the necessary drivers for your graphics card. Both these features improve the gaming experience in Vanilla OS.

During the initial boot, you can choose AppImage, Flatpak, or snaps to keep your apps updated.

Inorder to avoid unwanted system breaks, the core system in the Vanilla system is locked, and system update occurs with controlled atomic transactions.
