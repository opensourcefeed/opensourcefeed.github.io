**LXQt** is a modern, Qt based traditional desktop environment for GNU/Linux and other POSIX compatible operating systems. LXQt is often refered as successor of [LXDE](/desktop/lxde) another lightweight desktop environment built with Gtk 2.x.

LXQt offers a modern desktop environment with a traditional look and feel, which would be more productive for people who prefer traditional desktop environment.
