**LXQt** is a Qt-based, modern desktop environment for GNU/Linux and other POSIX compatible systems. It implements a traditional desktop experience with the latest innovations in the Qt framework. This helps users to stay productive, as the underlying desktop experience is unchanged.

LXQt can be considered as a blend of LXDE-Qt, a Qt migration of LXDE and Razor-Qt, an independent Qt-based desktop environment, which had the same goals as today's LXQt.

When the discussions started on LXQt, the initial plan was to make it as a successor of LXDE, another lightweight desktop environment built with the Gtk2.x framework. Presently, both desktop environments co-exist. In future, LXDE may be discontinued in favor of LXQt.
