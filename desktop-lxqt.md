**LXQt** is a Qt based, modern desktop environment for GNU/Linux and other POSIX compatible systems. It implements a traditional desktop experience with latest innovations in Qt framework. This helps users to stay productive, as the underlying desktop experience is unchanged.

When the discussions started on LXQt, the initial plan was to make it as a successor of LXDE, another lightweight desktop environment built with the Gtk2.x framework. Later, it was decided to keep both projects separately.
