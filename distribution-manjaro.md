**Manjaro** is an Arch based, rolling GNU/Linux distribution. It combines the powerful Arch base with user friendly
scripts and installers to make it usable for newbies and proffessionals alike. Official Manjaro ships KDE and Xfce
flavors. Additionally, there are community flavors featuring other desktop environments also.

Developed in Austria, France, and Germany, Manjaro provides all the benefits of the Arch operating system combined with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. Available in both 32 and 64 bit versions, Manjaro is suitable for newcomers as well as experienced Linux users.
