**Serpent OS** is an innovative, independent Linux distribution designed for users seeking a modern, efficient, and developer-friendly operating system. Built from the ground up, it prioritizes performance, stability, and a clean user experience, making it a standout choice in the Linux ecosystem.

One of Serpent OS's defining features is its atomic updates, which ensure that system changes are either fully applied or safely reverted, enhancing reliability and minimizing downtime. This stateless design, combined with a rolling-release model, allows users to enjoy the latest software without compromising system integrity.

The distribution is powered by cutting-edge technologies, including the LLVM/Clang compiler and Rust-based tools, which replace traditional utilities like coreutils and sudo with more secure and efficient alternatives. This modern approach extends to its moss package manager, which facilitates atomic transactions and seamless rollbacks, ensuring a robust upgrade process.

Serpent OS is designed exclusively for UEFI systems and supports both GNOME and COSMIC desktop environments, offering users a choice between a polished, familiar interface and a cutting-edge, Rust-based desktop experience67. Additionally, it includes NVIDIA GPU support and Steam compatibility, making it a viable option for gamers and multimedia enthusiasts.

With its focus on minimalism, security, and developer tools, Serpent OS is an excellent choice for advanced users and developers looking for a bloatware-free, high-performance Linux distribution. Its alpha release marks significant progress, with ongoing improvements in hardware support, documentation, and community engagement.

On 14th Feb 2025, Serpent OS team has announced their plan to rebrand the project as AerynOS to establish its identity in a positive way.
