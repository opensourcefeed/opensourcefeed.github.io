**Xfce** is a free, open-source desktop environment for Linux and Unix-like systems, renowned for its speed, lightweight footprint, and user-friendly interface. It provides a clean and intuitive experience, making it a popular choice for users seeking efficiency without sacrificing functionality.

## Origin of the Name "Xfce"

The name "Xfce" originally stood for "XForms Common Environment," reflecting its initial use of the XForms toolkit. However, after two major rewrites, Xfce no longer uses XForms, and the acronym's original meaning has been deprecated. The developers now treat "Xfce" as a name in its own right, without specific reference.
