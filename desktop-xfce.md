**Xfce** is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.

Xfce offers a traditional desktop experience with most modern technologies. It has a slow, but steady development path. With Xfce 4.14 release, all the core components have been migrated to Gtk 3.x.
