**Ubuntu Unity** is a community flavor of Ubuntu featuring the Unity shell. The Unity shell was first introduced by Ubuntu as its flagship desktop environment.

The Ubuntu Unity project took birth when Ubuntu decided to replace its flagship Unity shell with the GNOME shell. 

After Ubuntu, the Unity shell is maintained by a community of people who adores the virtues of unity, such as HUD and Global Menu. The Ubuntu Unity flavor takes the legendary Unity shell forward and blends it with the latest Ubuntu core.

On 1st September 2022, Ubuntu Unity got recognized as an official community flavor of Ubuntu.
