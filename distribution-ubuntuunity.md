**Ubuntu Unity** is a community flavor of Ubuntu featuring the Unity shell, first introduced by Ubuntu as its flagship desktop environment.

This project took birth when Ubuntu decided to discard its flagship Unity shell in favor of the GNOME shell. 

After Ubuntu, the Unity shell is maintained by a community of people who adores the virtues of unity, such as HUD and Global Menu. The Ubuntu Unity flavor takes the legendary of Unity shell forward and blends it with the latest Ubuntu core.
