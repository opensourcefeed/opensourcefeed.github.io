**Gnoppix Linux** is an open-source, **AI-powered Linux distribution** built for **privacy, security, and local AI processing**. Unlike cloud-reliant systems, Gnoppix processes all AI tasks directly on your device—keeping your data private while ensuring fast, offline performance.

Originally launched in 2003 by Andreas Müller as a pioneering LiveCD based on [Debian](/distribution/debian), Gnoppix influenced early Ubuntu development. Today, it combines the stability of Debian with AI capabilities, developer tools, and modern desktop environments like **GNOME**, **KDE Plasma**, and **Xfce**.

Gnoppix comes preloaded with popular AI and machine learning frameworks, making it ideal for **developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious users**. Whether you’re coding, creating, or just browsing, Gnoppix delivers a **secure, responsive, and user-friendly Linux experience**.
