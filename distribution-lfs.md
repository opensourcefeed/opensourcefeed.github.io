**Linux From Scratch** (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for 
building your own customized Linux system entirely from source.

Building LFS teaches you about all that makes Linux tick, how things work together and depend 
on each other. And most importantly, how to customize it to your own tastes and needs.
