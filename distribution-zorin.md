**Zorin OS** is a good choice for people migrating from other proprietary operating systems like Microsoft Windows and macOS. It combines solid Ubuntu base with a custom desktop environment called Zorin Desktop which can be customized to mimic the looks of a range of other desktop environments and operating systems like GNOME 2, GNOME 3, macOS, Windows classic, Windows 7 ..etc.

Zorin OS also ships a nice collection of themes which resembles other properietary operating systems and easy customization tools which will allow to choose between web browsers, desktop looks and feel ..etc.
