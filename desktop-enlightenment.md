**Enlightenment** was started as window manager project for X11 desktops back in 1996. After decades, the project still develops window manager. But it has evolved to support a wide range of devices like Mobile, Wearable and TV UI needs for projects such as Tizen as well as traditional the “desktop” UI.

The project is completely set to migrate to Wayland display technology as it is expected to be future of graphical display layer in Linux
