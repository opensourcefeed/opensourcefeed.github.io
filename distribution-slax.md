**Slax** is a live GNU/Linux distribution following modular and minimalistic design approach. It can be booted from any portable storage media without installing the operating system.

Despite being a small sized GNU/Linux distribution, Slax provides a well configured *Fluxbox* window manager with a minimal set of applications. This application set includes a command line tool and web browser.

Slax is built on top of Debian GNU/Linux and hence can take advantage of thousands of precompiled packages from Debian ecosystem. All these packages can be managed using the *apt* command.
