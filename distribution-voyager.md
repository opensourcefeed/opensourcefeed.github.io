**Voyager Live Linux** is a distribution from France built on the foundations of Ubuntu and Debian. It began as a customized Xubuntu project designed to combine performance, visual elegance, and everyday usability. The early Voyager releases used the XFCE desktop environment, chosen for its speed and efficiency. Voyager quickly became known for its thoughtful design, preconfigured tools, and consistent visual identity that set it apart from standard Ubuntu variants.

Beginning with the 18.10 release, Voyager switched to the GNOME Shell as its default desktop environment. This marked a major change in the projectâ€™s direction, adopting a more modern user interface while still maintaining its original XFCE edition for users who preferred a lightweight experience. Both versions continue to receive updates, giving users a choice between performance and contemporary design.

Over time, Voyager Live expanded beyond Ubuntu to include Debian-based editions, offering greater flexibility between stability and access to newer software. Through each evolution, Voyager Live has remained focused on delivering a fast, elegant, and ready-to-use Linux system that values simplicity, efficiency, and cohesive visual design.
