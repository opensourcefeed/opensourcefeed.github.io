**MX Linux** is a cooperative venture between the antiX and former MEPIS communities, using the
 best tools and talents from each distro. It is a midweight OS designed to combine an elegant and 
 efficient desktop with simple configuration, high stability, solid performance and medium-sized 
 footprint.
