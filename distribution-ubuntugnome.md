**Ubuntu GNOME** was an official community flavor of Ubuntu featuring vanilla GNOME Desktop Environment. This project was started when Ubuntu decided to go with Unity shell development, and a lot of users were not happy with that. The first unofficial release of Ubuntu GNOME was Ubuntu GNOME Remix 12.10, sooner it was accpeted as an official flavor and first official release was Ubuntu GNOME 13.04.

In late 2016, Canonical decided to stop investing on Unity shell and to integrated GNOME as default desktop environment. With this, Ubuntu GNOME project lost it's scope and was retired. The final stable release of Ubuntu GNOME was Ubuntu GNOME 17.04.
