Clover OS is a performance tuned, minimal GNU/Linux distribution derived from Gentoo. A set of scripts and package repository is used to build the Clover OS from Gentoo core.

Instead of delivering a completely customized distribution, Clover OS keeps the Gentoo base intact. It helps users to take advantage of all Gentoo features with ease.

On the default installation, Clover OS provides a minimal desktop with no other applications installed. This enables users to configure their system as per the requirement.
