KaOS, *A lean KDE distribution* is an independently developed, rolling GNU/Linux distribution. The idea behind KaOS is to deliver, a tightly integrated, rolling and transparent desktop operating system with a modern desktop environment.

Instead of providing several varieties, KaOS ships a single operating system - with one desktop environment (Plasma), one tool kit (Qt) and support of one architecture (x86_64). Unlike many other distributions, KaOS does not claim availability of large number of packages, instead they claim availability of quality packages.

KaOS provides updates snapshot in every month. These snapshots will include most up to date packages available for Plasma Desktop.
