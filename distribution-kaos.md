KaOS, *A lean KDE distribution* is an independently developed, rolling GNU/Linux distribution. The idea behind KaOS is to deliver a tightly integrated, rolling, and transparent desktop operating system with a modern desktop environment.

Instead of providing several varieties, KaOS ships a single operating system - with one desktop environment (Plasma), one toolkit (Qt), and support of one architecture (x86_64). 

Instead of providing a large number of packages, KaOS aims to deliver a few quality assured packages.

KaOS ships updated ISO snapshots every month. It provides users to stay up-to-date with the latest Plasma and other technologies in the open-source ecosystem.
