**Devuan** GNU+Linux is a free operating system started as a fork of Debian. Instead of working on top of original Debian, Devuan implements a fork without *systemd*, an init manager developed by Red Hat and later adopted by other GNU/Linux distributions. The target of Devuan is to free operating system from all the complexities involved while integrating with *systemd*.

Just like Debian, Devuan development is also carried out in 3 different branches, namely stable, testing and unstable. Current stable branch is *Jessy*, testing branch is *Ascii* and unstable branch is *Ceres*.
