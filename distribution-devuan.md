**Devuan** GNU+Linux is a free operating system started as a fork of Debian. Instead of working on top of the original Debian, Devuan implements a fork without *systemd*, an init manager developed by Red Hat and later adopted by other GNU/Linux distributions. The target of Devuan is to free the operating system from all the complexities involved while integrating with *systemd*.

Just like Debian, Devuan development is also carried out in 3 different branches, namely stable, testing, and unstable. The current stable branch is *Jessy*, the testing branch is *ASCII* and the unstable branch is *CERES*.

Instead of being an ideal desktop operating system, Devuan is planned to be a generic operating system that acts as a base for several other distributions, just like Debian does. Within a few years, several projects have conceived Devuan as their base operating system.

Some of the derivatives of Devuan include EterTICS, Exe GNU/Linux, Gnuinos, MIYO, Nelum-Dev1, Refracta, Star, heads, good-life-linux, Crowz ..etc. You can find the complete list of derivatives on [Devuan official website](https://www.devuan.org/os/devuan-distros).
