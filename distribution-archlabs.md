**ArchLabs** is a rolling GNU/Linux distribution featuring a well tweaked Openbox window manager. ArchLabs is inspired and influenced by the look and feel of Busenlabs.

At the initial stages of development, ArchLabs was following the look and feel established by the Busnelabs. In later phases, ArchLabs developed it's own style and feel and it is longer a *fork* (at least in style) of BusenLabs.

Another difference between ArchLabs and BusenLabs is base distribution. BusenLabs is based on Debian *stable* release, while ArchLabs is based on Arch and follows a rolling release model.
