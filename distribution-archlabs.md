**ArchLabs** was a rolling GNU/Linux distribution that featured a well-tweaked Openbox window manager. The project was inspired and influenced by the look and feel of BunsenLabs. However, it's important to note that as of 7th June 2023, the ArchLabs project has been discontinued.

In its early stages of development, ArchLabs closely followed the look and feel established by BunsenLabs. However, as the project progressed, ArchLabs developed its own distinctive style and feel, and it is no longer considered a *fork* (at least in style) of BunsenLabs.

One of the key distinctions between ArchLabs and BunsenLabs lies in their base distributions. While BunsenLabs is based on Debian's *stable* release, ArchLabs opted for a base built on Arch Linux, following a rolling release model. Despite its discontinuation, ArchLabs had carved out its niche as a rolling release distribution with a unique Openbox configuration. Users seeking a similar experience may explore alternative distributions that align with their preferences and requirements.
