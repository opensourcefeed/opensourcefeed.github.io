**Korora** is a Fedora based GNU/Linux distribution with purpose of making GNU/Linux distributions accessible for freshers, without ignoring its expert users. In 2005, Korora was started as a Gentoo based distribution, and in 2010 it was reintroduced as a Fedora remix.

Instead of shipping vanilla user experience from Fedora, Korora brings various tweaks and includes several addons and plugins to make it *work* out of the box. Korora also enables multiple 3rd party repositories to give various packages which Fedora does not include due to ideological reasons.

In addition to various day-to-day applications, Korora brings proprietary components like Google Chrome, Adobe Flash, Google Earth, Google Talk ..etc.
