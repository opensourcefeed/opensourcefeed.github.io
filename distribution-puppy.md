**Puppy Linux** is a family of relatively small sized GNU/Linux distributions having common principles, built using the same set of tools. It ships with a unique set of applications and configurations to provide a consistent user experience, across the distributions.

Mainly, we can classify Puppy Linux distributions into three categories.

* *The official Puppy Linux distributions* are general purpose GNU/Linux distributions maintained by Puppy Linux team. This is made using Puppy Linux system builder, ie, Woof-CE.
* *The woof-built Puppy distributions* are also made using Woof-CE. It is customized to fulfill certain specific needs may provide a different look & feel.
* *The unofficial derivatives (aka puplets)* are Puppy based custom distributions made by Puppy Linux community.
