Trinity Desktop Environment or TDE is a lightweight desktop environment that provides a traditional desktop experience. Historically, Trinity is derived from KDE 3.x series.

The name *Trinity* indicates 3, which carries the legacy of KDE 3.x.

In addition to retaining the traditional appearance and functionality, Trinity desktop has the following objectives.

- Flexibility and customizability
- Visually appealing
- A set of desktop effects compatible with older hardware
- Compatible with modern hardware, still responsive on older hardware
- Support for 3D acceleration, but not mandatory.
