**CRUX** is a lightweight GNU/Linux distribution targeting advanced users. This distribution keeps everything *simple* without hiding a lot under the hood. It provides a .tar.gz based package system, BSD inspired initscripts and relatively smaller collection of packages.

CRUX also includes a ports system which makes installing and upgrading packages easier.
