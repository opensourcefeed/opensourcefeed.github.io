**Siduction** is a rolling GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian. The name Siduction is a combination of sid and seducing. Sid indicates its relation with the Debian Sid branch. Siduction is based on Debian sid - the unstable and rolling branch of Debian.

Siduction was created in July 2011 from the former Aptosid community. The goal of the distribution was to gather and work on user opinions whenever it makes sense. Also, the project is planning to contribute to Debian as much as possible. In Siduction, Free software and free drivers are always preferred. Still, users can opt for non-free software if they wish.
