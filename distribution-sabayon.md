**Sabayon** is a Gentoo based, rolling GNU/Linux distribution that promises an out of the box user experience. Unlike the parent distribution, it comes with a set of well-configured desktops and applications to serve the day to day computing needs of users.

When Gentoo encourages users to compile each and every package from source code, Sabayon provides precompiled packages in project's official and community repositories. It helps the users to install applications without making their hands dirty.

There are several variations of Sabayon, which includes Desktop, Server, Cloud and testing editions. The desktop edition is available with different desktop environments like Plasma, GNOME, MATE & Xfce.
