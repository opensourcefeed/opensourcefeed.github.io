**Regolith** is an innovative desktop environment designed to improve productivity. With a highly customized i3 Window Manager on top of GNOME Shell, it provides everything you need and helps to focus on your work without too much clutter.

Regolith is coming with a set of preconfigured keyboard shortcuts and tools, which makes it easier to open applications, arrange them, and navigating between opened applications.

In addition to a repository for installing Regolith on a native Ubuntu release, Regolith also offers a stand-alone distribution built on top of Ubuntu. It helps to explore Regolith without installing and to install a fresh system with Regolith preconfigured.
