**Apricity** (formerly Cinnarch) was a beautiful, rolling GNU/Linux distribution based on Arch. The project was well known
for it's nicely crafted desktop environments,ie, Cinnamon and GNOME Shell. Instead of shipping the vanilla desktop environments,
the project used to ship a nicely tweaked user experience to provide a visually appealing distribution. It had a nice choice
of Gtk and icon themes, applications and other desktop environment extensions.

The project was discontinued due to lack of man power to handle day to day activities of project.
