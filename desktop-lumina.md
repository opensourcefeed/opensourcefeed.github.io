**Lumina Desktop** is a lightweight and simple desktop environment developed by TrueOS project and it can be used in most of the POSIX enabled operating systems including various GNU/Linux and BSD distributions.

Lumina Desktop is highly customizable with various profiles available and you can enable additional features by installing extra plugins. A system-wide default layout is also included and can be configured by the system administrator. This allows every system (or user session) to be designed to maximize the individual user's productivity. 

Lumina Desktop is not derived from other desktop code base. It is written from scratch using C++ and Qt5 framework. Lumina is a simple interface between the user and operating system. It communicates directly with the operating system to make it easily portable and customizable.
