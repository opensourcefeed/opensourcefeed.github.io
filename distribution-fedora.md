reviews :
  "Fedora 28 is another solid release, though vanilla gnome looks somewhat dull" : "https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20180514#fedora"
  "Fedora 27 makes desktop operating system less relevant with too many bugs & crashes - Dedoimedo" : "https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/fedora-27-gnome.html"
  "Fedora 27 is more like a testing ground and provides less polished user experience - DistroWatch" : "http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20171120#fedora"
  Fedora 25 is not something worth to recommend: "http://open-source-feed.blogspot.com/2017/02/fedora-25-is-not-something-worth-to.html"

**Fedora** is an independently developed GNU/Linux distribution backed by open source giant Red Hat. Fedora is a cutting-edge distribution that ships new releases in a rough period of 6 months.

Fedora is often referred as an experimental bed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Most of the bleed edge technologies will be introduced in Fedora first, and once it becomes stable, the same technology will be adopted in Enterprise Linux as well.

Fedora comes in different variations, which includes Fedora Workstation, Fedora spins Fedora labs, Fedora server edition, Fedora cloud edition and ARM variations. Fedora spins showcase different desktop environments, while Fedora labs are distributions oriented towards different fields such as security, robotics, electronics, games ..etc.
