						<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>Like most website operators, OpenSourceFeed collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, OpenSourceFeed may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>OpenSourceFeed also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.opensourcefeed.org blog posts. OpenSourceFeed only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

			<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
