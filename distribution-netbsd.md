**NetBSD** is a free, high performing, secure and portable open-source operating system. It supports a wide variety of platforms ranging from small embedded devices to powerful desktop systems and large-scale servers. Its clean and advanced features make it a good choice for production and research environment.

NetBSD is developed by the collaborative effort of a group of people around the world. It also makes use of other free software like 4.4BSD Lite2 developed at UC Berkeley.
