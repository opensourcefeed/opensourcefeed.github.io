**Bodhi Linux** is a *enlightened* distribution based on Ubuntu LTS releases. The key idea of Bodhi Linux is to develop a minimal and resource-efficient operating system. This distribution comes with a few essential applications and leaves the users with the choice to select their preferred applications.

Bodhi Linux features the Moksha Desktop environment, a lightweight desktop environment developed by the Bodhi Linux team. Moksha Desktop is inspired by Enlightenment 17 release. The main purpose of developing a new desktop environment was to retain the Enlightenment 17 experience when Enlightenment was moving to a different perspective of the desktop environment.
