**Tails** (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a Debian-based Linux distribution to provide privacy and anonymity while using the internet. Tails is a live operating system, which means it runs from a USB stick or DVD without installing anything on the computer's hard drive. The system is designed to leave no trace of your activities on the computer you're using and automatically routes all internet traffic through the Tor network to conceal your IP address and location.

Tails comes with a range of privacy and security tools, including the Tor Browser, encrypted email and chat clients, and secure file storage. It also includes a suite of tools for anonymizing and encrypting your communications and files, such as GnuPG encryption, Off-the-Record messaging, and a KeePassX password manager.

Tails is often used by journalists, activists, whistleblowers, and anyone else who needs to communicate or access information securely and anonymously. However, it's important to note that using Tails alone can not guarantee complete anonymity or security, and proper operational security practices are still essential.
