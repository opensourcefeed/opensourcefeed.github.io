**Mageia** is a community driven GNU/Linux operating system backed by a non-profit organization of elected contributors. Initially, it was started as a fork of Mandriva Linux in 2010. Over the years, Mageia has developed a lot and has become a full-fledged GNU/Linux distribution with its own brand name and identity.

The main motto of the Mageia project is told as *to build great tools for people*. The goal of the Mageia project is to be a credible and recognizable community in the free software world.
