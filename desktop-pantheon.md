**Pantheon** is flagship desktop environment of elementary OS, and it is being developed and maintained
by elmentary project. It comes with deeply integrated components like the dock (plank), top panel named
*Wingpanel*, Slingshot application launcher, custom window manager named *Gala* which is based on Mutter.

In look and feel, Pantheon desktop resembles with popular proprietary operating systems like macOS. Though elementary is following a different design approach.

Pantheon project was started as part of elementary OS only. However, there are experiments going on, to integrate Pantheon desktop with other popular distributions like Fedora and openSUSE.
