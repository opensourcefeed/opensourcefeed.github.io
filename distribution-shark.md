**Shark Linux** is a continuous release operating system based on Debian/Ubuntu. Unlike most of the operating systems, Shark Linux usually does not version its releases.

Shark is built on top Ubuntu LTS releases. However, it maintains it's own repository to provide critical packages. You can also switch your system to *edge* release which will help you to have latest package updates.

Shark cares at most for the security and maintains it's own file system to make sure that all packages are up to date. In addition to various tools and packages, Shark includes single click scripts to run various tasks. These tasks include installation of additional plugins and tools, container technology installation and deployments, various virtualization technologies ..etc.
