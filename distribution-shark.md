**Shark Linux** is a continuous release operating system based on Debian/Ubuntu. Unlike most of the operating systems, Shark does not version it's releases.

Shark is built on top Ubuntu LTS releases. However, it maintains it's own repository to provide critical packages. You can also switch your system to *edge* release wich will help you to have latest package updates.

Shark cares at most for the security and maintains it's own file system to make sure that all packages are up to date. In addition to various tools and pacakges, Shark includes single click scripts to run various tasks. These tasks includes installation of additional plguins and tools, container technology installation and deployements, various virtualization technologies ..etc.
