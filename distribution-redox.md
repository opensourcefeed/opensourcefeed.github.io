**Redox OS** is a Unix-like, microkernel-based operating system written in Rust, designed to be a secure and modern alternative to Linux and BSD. By using Rust, Redox OS brings safety and performance to its core, reducing common vulnerabilities. Inspired by systems like Plan 9, Minix, and seL4, Redox OS combines innovative design with a complete set of features.

Redox OS offers partial POSIX compatibility and can run Linux and BSD programs, making it easy to use existing software. It includes a custom C library in Rust (relibc) and supports the Rust standard library. With its drivers running in userspace, Redox OS enhances stability and security. Users can also enjoy an optional graphical interface called Orbital, along with common Unix/Linux tools, providing a familiar experience. Licensed under MIT, Redox OS is open-source and free for developers and enthusiasts.
